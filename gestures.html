    Do you think you can post something without sounding like an HP sheep for a change? You completely devalued this video, and anything it had the chance of doing, because you're greedy... How sad...﻿

    Can we have a serious discussion specifically on this issue? I'd like to ask you to explain why Lindsey should not partner with HP, and in turn, I'll give reasons why she should. Let's keep it to this topic alone. I want to understand your reasons for believing Lindsey is wrong to partner with the people at HP. I'll start.

    1. Lindsey and HP share a common problem. Lindsey's supporters no longer support her the way they used to. This isn't intentional, but Lindsey's biggest audience, millennials, are the biggest users of ad blocking software. A July 2016 study showed that two-thirds of American millennials now use ad blocking software. This suggests that only one out of every three views on Lindsey's videos generates revenue. The problem is even bigger for HP employees. Two-thirds of their audience is unreachable via traditional online advertising. Millennials have also changed their TV watching habits and now watch more than 40% less television than they did five years ago. HP needs to find more effective ways to reach its audience, and Lindsey needs to stabilize declining ad revenue that she relies on to pay her employees. The audience has changed its habits, and companies like HP and artists like Lindsey must respond. 

    2. HP is a large organization that's well-suited for committing to long term partnerships with artists like Lindsey. According to HP, this is a one-year partnership with Lindsey. This affords her stability she needs as an employer with large responsibilities. Sponsorship deals with small businesses for single projects do not afford the same revenue stability. Furthermore, unlike with private companies, helping HP offers a very direct way to give back to society and help the economy. HP is a publicly traded corporation, which essentially means it is owned by everyone who purchases its stock. HP regularly pays dividends to its shareholders. When HP does well, the greatest portion of the benefit goes to people who do not work for HP.

    3. Americans have an overall positive view of corporations. A January 2017 study concluded 56% of Americans hold a favorable view of corporations, while 37% hold an unfavorable view. Appreciation for corporations increases with education, income, and to a lesser extent, age. Among tech corporations, approval jumps, with studies showing over 80% approval. With this data, we may say that Lindsey likely holds a positive view of tech corporations like HP and YouTube and sees no moral sacrifice in partnering with them for mutual benefit and the benefit of her audience. Lindsey should also feel good about promoting the HP Sprocket, since its reviews on Amazon are extremely positive. People who buy the Sprocket generally love it.

    Ad revenue is an effective way for Lindsey to earn a living, providing us with content at no cost to us. Much of what we all rely on today is supported by this business model. But the model has to shift to keep up with the audience, and I think we can reasonably expect to see many partnerships like this in the future. I personally enjoy Lindsey's approach of demonstrating how she used a product she helps market to bring a smile to her friend. Like most people today, Lindsey earns her living by providing services for others, and in this case, her service rewarded Erich both emotionally and financially. That's a neat application of creativity.

    Can you please explain your reasons Lindsey should not work with HP?﻿

    communityband1 She's already a multimillionaire from doing her touring and she's able to continue doing so employing her people while also making charitable contributions (she's a devout Mormon so I suspect her church is very happy that she makes as much money as she can). But even the biggest stars like Katy Perry and Taylor Swift succumb to doing ads, possibly because they started out early in their careers with little money so they still have the earning urge but it's also possible their managers encourage it because doing them increases the star visibility which results in high tour attendance.﻿

    communityband1: I'm not even getting into this issue with you, because you're missing the problem. I would advise you to first consult the person above me, as he seems to realize the problem, based on his comment on this video, which you should read yourself, because it should provide some clarity for you, and it is not at all difficult to find, maybe a few scrolls down. The main issue stems off into a series of them, which I'll have little trouble explaining to you, in detail. I'll conclude by advising you to take a far different approach to your usual method of analysis, as it should help you realize the problem.﻿

    John: You've frequently talked about how people give you "sheep" answers, but this seems very much like you are shying away from a real discussion. I'm asking you to explain why working with people at HP is a problem. I read every top-level comment on this video. A few people point out the advertising. A subset of that small number suggests that this detracts from the action. But I'm not asking whether or not a few people felt this way. I'm asking you to defend in logical terms why it is wrong for Lindsey to work with HP.

    I fully understand that the team here collaborated to make an ad. Erich probably understood this, at least to some extent or at some point. But you made an unsubstantiated claim when you said, "If this was genuine, HP wouldn't have been involved." Aspects of that are likely untrue regardless. We know Lindsey intended to make an ad, but we have no indication that she did not use the opportunity to think up something nice to do for Erich. In any event, it seems unlikely that Erich's children and family were coached in telling their dad they love him. And it's also very unlikely that Erich was not moved in seeing his family. This is important to understand. Most people earn a living - make money - by performing acts of service. That's what it means to have a service-oriented economy. But the kindness and effectiveness of people's actions is not negated simply because they earn money providing their services. Earning money and showing genuine kindness are not mutually exclusive. We all do it.

    However, all of that is diving too deep and getting away from the real issue here. I am in fact asking people like you who "feel" something is wrong with working with HP to think critically about this and justify that feeling. The people of HP are trying to make a living. They have created a product which appeals to the same type of people who like Lindsey's art. They face new challenges reaching this audience. Likewise, Lindsey faces new challenges earning her previous level of income due to changes in her audience's behavior. Why is it wrong for Lindsey to work with HP to find solutions that benefit everyone, including us? We, the public, chose advertising as our preferred method of paying for the content we consume.

    I'm not saying a few people haven't felt as you do. I'm giving reasons they should change their minds, because objectively it's clear we all gain from this. You have thus far only hinted at emotional reasons as the basis of your argument, and I want you to defend those emotions with solid logic. Should you actually feel this way, or should you change your mind? What is logically, solidly wrong with Lindsey working with HP? What are the real problems this causes?﻿

    Bruce: (edit: I should have mentioned, this is partly a reply to your separate comment that John asked me to read for its relevance here.) There is no question Lindsey makes money. But there is some doubt about how much. Older estimates of Lindsey's net worth put her anywhere from $6 to $10 million. Estimates this year put the figure at closer to $2 million. Either way we look at it, net worth is not equivalent to spending cash, and Lindsey's projects require quite a bit of that. Lindsey's touring success depends on her ability to create fan familiarity with her content before her tours, meaning that she needs to create compelling new content to keep interest high. 

    But ultimately, I'm not presenting my argument by saying, "Well, Lindsey needs money, so we should forgive her for this." I'm saying there is nothing to forgive, because the action itself is beneficial to everyone, including us. We are not worse off because Lindsey created a video that helps HP achieve product awareness and helps Lindsey invest more money into her business and the businesses of those who work with her to create her products. We gain from this because an artist we support has greater spending power to invest in her craft, and we gain from this because money moving around in an economy finds its away around to us. There is no doubt that traditional methods of advertising no longer bring in the same money they used to. This presents a problem for all of us that goes far beyond Lindsey's videos. We should recognize that we have a stake in the solution to this problem. For our economy to work properly, businesses must be able to make people aware of their offerings.﻿

    communityband1: Why change from the other video back to this one, you'll likely be wondering. The answer is because other parties being involved in conversations is frustrating, and many people have demonstrated sheepishness beyond the point of my willingness to tolerate...   

    As to the question on here, being the other subject will undoubtedly come up another time, about her being lazy, trending is bias, etc, financially, Lindsey stands to gain from HP, but at the cost of several things. 

    It's no secret, or at least it shouldn't be to you, there already exists a negative stigma around corporations utilizing celebrities to promote their products, mainly falling on the celebrity themselves, and for good reason. The celebrity in question comes off as greedy and usually is being greedy. Lindsey has explored numerous avenues in ways to make financial gain, her music, her tours, her book, her merchandise, etc. As like Katy Perry, she's got plenty of money from these avenues, but, because "enough is never enough," she finds the need to get even more, in the most morally backwards of ways. How is a partnership backwards?  

    1. The notion of her promoting a company, one which she never mentioned prior to the contract, likely never used a single product by them, but, out of the clear blue sky, suddenly "loves" them is faked, forced, and untrue, and she only "loves" the company, because she's sucking up and saying she "loves" them for more money. It's bold-faced lying... I'll bet you, when they cut her off, a year you said, if I recall, she'll never bring them up again, proving she sucked up, cramming her false love of the company down her fans' throats, getting them to buy their product, which many never would've considered otherwise had she not brought the product up, but she never actually loved the company, only the money the gave her, which is, as I said, lying. 

    2. The fact she's willing to take something so meaningful, and use it as an advertising ploy is equally as fake and forced. It's like filming a wedding, but, as opposed to focusing on the wedding, the photographer spends every other second mentioning the camera he's using. The wedding isn't fake, and the emotions aren't fake, but the focus is misplaced and selfish, same as it is here. The concept wasn't HP scripting the idea (I think...) but the constant focus on the product makes the actual sincerity of the video feel misplaced and hallow. 

    3. As I've mentioned in the past, the fact she's willing to take her own art, all be it the original was awful, too, but I digress, and turn it into an advertisement is desecrating the beauty of the piece. How would you like it if one of John Williams's scores was used to promote a Viagra pill or Victoria's Secret bra? At least in my mind, it's taking musical art and sullying the piece. "Hold My Heart" is no longer a meaningful piece of art, it's the HP commercial song... If I ever hear anything from Shatter Me being used so tastelessly, I will scream... Hold My Heart is NOT supposed to be for a commercial. It was supposed to represent something deep, meaningful, and even though the original video failed miserably to achieve it, turning the song into HP's unofficial jingle for HP Sprocket is far worse. 

    In summation, Lindsey gets more money from HP, but she pays a greater price for financial gain, which she didn't need, having so many other avenues giving her money. She sold something meaningful for cash, and I'm grateful Shatter Me hasn't fallen victim to her quickness to ruin her past messages by turning them into a company's unofficial song. What do you think if you listen to Shatter Me? I think of something beautiful, a ballerina escaping from a prison and being free to explore the bright future ahead. What do you think of if you listen to Hold My Heart? I think of a handheld printer... You don't view her past music with feeling and emotion, appreciate the depth of its meaning. You view her past music for it's composition and score. You view everything she does with numbers. You don't view her actions as shallow. There's the reason you and I will never agree, two different aspects. I feel her music. You study it... If I looked at a painting, I'd look for a message the artist wanted to get across. You would see the method of panting he used... 

    There's another interesting thing I found out earlier. Lindsey isn't even recording with LindseyStomp LLC for this Christmas album of hers. She's recording it with Capitol Records. I guess the pride she claimed to have from being herself, using her own record label, was another one of her lies. Lindsey is so good with lies. It's easy for her blind fans to never question her, catch her lying, but, if someone isn't blind, it's interesting, how many she's told. I've caught 7 of them, some on blogs, some in her book, and some in Q&A's, most of them trivial, but she's still lying, isn't she? So, is Lindsey a loving sweetheart or a lying corporate sheep?﻿

    Thanks for answering. I'm going to start by clarifying something and then use that to transition back. You say that I only consider the intellectual aspects of Lindsey's music. That's not true. If I listened to music for the purpose of analyzing it, my taste in music would be very different. When I listen to Shatter Me, I don't think of a ballerina, but rather of breaking through mental barriers that hold us back. Hold My Heart reminds me of a problem we have in society with people using relationships to define themselves. It very much fits in with my impression of Lindsey as a strong person who sees the need to encourage young women to push past traditional roles, recognize they can stand alone, and fit relationships in as a wonderful supplement to their lives, not as compensation for their shortcomings. I'm pretty passionate about this message myself. I'm not the "robot" you picture me as.

    I'm also passionate about fighting back against harmful stereotypes that hold society back, including the one we're talking about here. In all of your response, you completely left out most of the people involved - the people of HP. Society brainwashes us to think of corporations as soulless entities designed to serve a wealthy few. This is incredibly shortsighted, and it leads nations to vote for decisions that work against them. Simplistic views like "corporations are evil" are dangerous. We must be more nuanced and understand that actions - not groups of people - are good or bad.

    If you look over your points again, can you see how each of them essentially amounts to how people personally choose to feel about things? That's exactly what I'm challenging - how we choose to feel about this. I gave a list of measurable, physical benefits. In practical terms, this partnership produces winners - people have jobs, they get to eat, we get content with greater financial backing, we learn things, etc. Beyond what someone might choose to feel, there are no downsides. And this begs the question - if the actions result in benefits, shouldn't that affect how we feel about them? If a feeling interferes with things that help everyone, including ourselves, is that feeling justified?

    For the heck of it, I Googled "stigma corporations celebrities." I didn't get anything. Now I'm not disagreeing that people complain about celebrities working with advertisers. But this is incredibly ingrained in our society, and we're long past the stage of broad acceptance. We can't watch television for an hour without seeing a celebrity promote a product. People don't really look down on celebrities much for this. A quick look at the most successful celebrities confirms this. They all advertise, and if it hurt them, they wouldn't be the most successful celebrities. More importantly, if we use stigmas as an argument for saying celebrities shouldn't do it, it's like saying, "People feel like it's bad, so it is bad."

    Your decision to feel badly about Lindsey promoting HP products seems predicated on strange assumptions. First, I don't recall Lindsey ever saying she loves HP. We have no understanding here in the United States that celebrities "love" the companies they promote. The most we can say is that Lindsey has made clear that she avoids getting involved with people or products which go against her values. Lindsey has certainly worked with HP products in the past. Perhaps in the UK you've been less exposed to HP's products, but here in the U.S. you really can't have gone through the 80's, 90's and early 2000's without some exposure to HP computers and printers. HP developed a strong reputation for quality in the 80's and 90's, and the company had a family-run feel. Given Lindsey's appreciation for women in technology, she may also be aware that HP was the first Fortune 50 company to employ a female CEO. HP still has a positive reputation in America. For women, it's the 9th most popular company they'd like to work for. For millennials, it's number 3, behind Microsoft and Walt Disney.

    But ultimately, we don't have to believe Lindsey feels anything in particular for HP. All she has done is demonstrate the Sprocket's use in a situation we can relate to. We don't need to love people in order to help them. The HP team, like Lindsey, creates products for people, and they need to share their work with their audience. Lindsey can help them with that. The product isn't evil. The people aren't evil. The goal isn't evil. 

    In your second point, you talk about how you feel about the story as a result of understanding its dual purpose. You are in control of that feeling, just as I am. I also instantly recognized this was created to advertise the Sprocket. But I felt good about it, because I saw the mutual benefits involved. Erich and his family were brought together. His friends did something fun together. People learned about the work the people at HP are doing. Lindsey and her staff earned money that will compensate people who help her create stuff I'll see someday. HP's stockholders will receive stock dividends that allow them to purchase more products, and the money will find its way to me in a very roundabout fashion. These are real, physical benefits. And I'm at an advantage over you because I also feel good. I enjoy seeing Lindsey put thought into showing practical use of what she's advertising. That's innovative. I embrace the clear, dual purpose of this video, and I appreciate it for that.

    In your third point, you talk about how you feel about music in relation to your feelings about products and advertisements. It truly comes down to your choice. You can freely look around these comments and see that most people make a different choice, and they leave with positive feelings. From the comments it's apparent that most people aren't focusing on the advertising. But even for those of us who do think about the advertising, it's still our choice how to feel about it. I wonder what you would say if I told you I think it's shallow to say that the meaning of the lyrics in those songs is deeper than the value of the advertising. I think you're overlooking the physical value brought to people's lives. Lyrics are wonderful and powerful, and they can make us discover new truths. But Lindsey's partnership with the people at HP is bringing food to plates, paying for educations, and saving lives through charities. She is helping people in a very direct way. This is all about our choice in how we look at things, and if we open our minds and look at the big picture, we'll see what she sees.

    Lindsey has worked with outside publishers for years in Europe. It's an obvious choice. In a single word - distribution. If Lindsey wants to get her Christmas album into retail chains for the holidays, she needs to work with people who have those channels set up and know that business. She has discussed this in the past. Again, it's unfortunate that you look at a company as something other than a group of people earning a living by providing value. Lindsey will bring value to their lives, and they will bring value to hers. And together, they will share something that some people will deem to have value in their lives. We've been doing this for thousands of years now, and it really works pretty well.﻿

    Lindsey accepted the job of helping HP share the Sprocket. That's a good cause. She thought up a way to demonstrate the Sprocket by bringing joy to Erich and his family. That's a thoughtful and inspiring application. There is no deception here. We all understand Lindsey advertises the Sprocket. We all understand that she planned this around the Sprocket. She took a job and figured out a way to complete it making people's lives better. I love that. That type of thinking moves the world forward. I will always look for opportunities to earn a living while helping to enrich people's lives.﻿

    communityband1 Thank you for you adding your thoughtful opinion to the discussion. For me, I love Lindsey and wish her continued success. However, I would respect her more if she, like other big stars, would just do her commercials directly in the conventional way. If she likes a product and wants to tell her fans about it would be more engaging if she didn't do it in a contrived sketch.﻿

    Thanks, Bruce. I agree that a direct approach would be something people are more familiar with and may have objected to less. I don't know the particulars of the arrangement reached with HP, and I wonder if they were looking to try something new. I find it interesting. One thing I've learned watching Lindsey is that she really is a pretty terrible actor. :-) It's funny in a heartwarming way to watch her try to pull off roles in her videos. Knowing this about her though, it makes me realize there are key parts of this video she is totally incapable of faking, like her momentary frustration when Erich thought the pictures were of her. I believe she intended this to be a surprise for Erich, and she was feeling real anticipation for the reveal. I agree Lindsey wouldn't have done this if she hadn't needed to advertise the Sprocket. But I think she used the opportunity to do something real to her.﻿

    communityband1: So, in essence, you're entire argument is saying it's a matter of perspective, the majority's perspective being less likely to view this as the minority's perspective? There's a dangerous way of thinking, as some of the majority's perspectives, in the past, have been terrible. The majority used to believe woman were lesser to men. The majority used to think race was a determining factor of superiority. These majority opinions were argued by the minority to result in a switch. Of course, these are far worse than negative views on corporations and celebrities, but you realize the issue I'm saying, which is majority isn't always the best perspective to hold, especially bias majority, given many of the positive comments will have been left by sheep... Seriously, some of these people could be told, by Lindsey herself, they can jump in a river, and they would say "which one" before being offended... I will back up my claim utilizing something from our past discussion, your example for me, CWS. It's a case of being so enamored with Lindsey, people fail to use their better judgement or question her morality. I'll continue to back this up with myself. As impossible as the notion seems, in the past, prior to my realization of things, I never questioned anything Lindsey did, and, if anyone said something about her, I was one of the first to get offended. How things changed... I'll conclude by saying you still have a very grandiose illusion of companies. I've gone on to research a great many larger corporations, even ones I have partaken in, to be surprised on the dark things going on behind closed doors. Let's not forget, Disney has Lindsey in their pocket, too, like HP. Wonderful... Plus, let's be realistic. Lindsey doesn't support HP for the reasons you gave, only because they offered her a contract... If I was a better businessman myself, and I could offer her a few million dollars, she would support me, too..﻿

    I left this part as a separate portion, because it's not necessarily important, but it's still something I fail to imagine. I haven't been given much, or anything, to give me any kind of impression you're the type to feel music... You've focused heavily Lindsey's violin composition in your arguments and focused on challenging me to name her bars, indicating, to me, you've analyzed her music from a robotic stance, but you've not focused on much else. Yes, you appreciate music. No, I don't think you feel it. If a piece makes you think "this is such a mastery of this instrument," that's appreciating the music. If a piece strikes you so hard, it can make you cry, that's feeling music. What do you do? I do the second. I'll point out, for some reason, this was difficult to get on here...﻿

    That really wasn't my intended meaning. It's not just a matter of perspective, because there are real world, physical benefits that we all receive from this regardless of how we choose to look at things. It's objectively quantifiable. Through this partnership, Lindsey creates tangible benefits for everyone. We're all literally better off. The only possible loss we have discussed is self-created by choosing to be upset. And I believe that being upset is illogical when every person involved has experienced positive gain. The team felt real, positive emotions, and the fact that it began with a challenge for Lindsey to figure out a creative way to use the Sprocket didn't stop that. It initiated it! The people in HP's struggling printer business have something of a success story with the Sprocket, and Lindsey is helping them keep their jobs. The profits for the company are paid out to shareholders who might be us, might pay us money in a roundabout way, or might employ us. The money Lindsey makes gets invested in people who work with and for her. These are wonderful reasons to be pleased. We have all of these good things to look at, and we have a choice. We can either say, "Lindsey wouldn't have done this particular nice thing for Erich if not for the money!" or we can say, "A job required Lindsey to help HP and led her to think up a creative way to do something nice for Erich." Neither of these is more or less true than the other. But if we choose the latter way of looking at it, we can also be happy as we enjoy the many real-world benefits that absolutely exist regardless of what goes on in our heads.

    Regarding music - I hope you will think about your words more, because I believe your conclusion about me shows the same thing getting in your way of understanding Lindsey. You will help yourself if you immediately dismiss the idea that someone can lack the same rich and complex emotions you do. If you think about it a little more, I think you'll understand how unreasonable it is to suggest I could devote decades of my life to something that has no emotional impact on me. Of course music makes me cry. Motivation is emotional and is the foundation of everything we do. People are driven by their emotions. Look at Lindsey again. She now has unlimited choices in how she makes money. She can use money to make money and never work again. But she creates art because she's passionate about it, and she's passionate about performing for people. You should also look for passion in people who run businesses. It takes unbelievable drive and belief in the value of a mission to put in the time to run a successful business. And successful business people are also among the most likely to be passionate for charitable causes. Look for passion in people. It's all over the place, and it's really neat to see. People are complex and driven by emotion, and money doesn't defeat that. Money is just a tool people try to acquire so they can pursue the things they truly care about.

    As humans, we tend to put things into boxes and label them. Our brains are designed to work this way in order to deal with complexity. But we have to be careful. We shouldn't put people in boxes that simplify their motives and emotions down to a catchphrase. Lindsey the corporate sheep. Lindsey who cares for nothing but fame and fortune. Sheep fans. Me, the robot. Business people who care for nothing but money. It's fantasy. It's pop culture myth. It's a way we chat with friends about people we've never met, and yet oddly enough, our own close friends never seem to fit into such simple boxes. We'll never understand anyone if we simplify people that way. Everyone is much too complex to be summarized like that. I know you've felt alone, but you're not alone in this way. Every person is a battleground of infinite emotion. Married couples spend their entire lives learning more about their partners, because there is always more to learn. We can't even figure ourselves out half the time.

    I promise you've oversimplified Lindsey and what motivates her. Over this past year, this is a girl who flew back to see her dying father between every tour stop. She's a girl who still breaks down in tears feeling she isn't good enough to perform. She's a girl who is passionate about causes and making a difference in people's lives. She's a girl who feels responsible for the livelihood of dozens of people. She's a person with emotions as rich as yours and mine. If you don't mind, will you please watch her Hallelujah video again and watch her at the end? I believe that's as real as people get.﻿

    communityband1: I'm not definitively saying you're unable to feel music, only suggesting it's not something I can feasibly imagine, because it's not the impression you give off, based on the communication you've had with me over these past discussions. Essentially, you come off as a Watson computer, very apathetic, many times, spitting out facts without any expression of human emotion. I'd say define happiness, you would give me a reply a computer would, a series of chemical reactions in the body, as opposed to saying a feeling of being content. I analyze the ways people respond to me, and, if it's more than a single sentence, can draw a profile of their person. Depending on the length, this can either be strengthened or weakened. My profile of you seems relatively consistent, minus a few scant outlying factors. This is reason it's next to impossible to imagine you feel music, but it's a useless topic. Yet, it's very much the same way I analyze Lindsey's person, her motives, moral standing, etc. 

    If I've oversimplified Lindsey, your and my conservation would've concluded many months ago, as I wouldn't have anything to offer you as a reply, like two children squabbling, one being logical, the other saying, "you're   a dimwit," to every word the first says. Yes, the basis could be comparable to this situation, if boiled down to the way you outlined it. "Lindsey the corporate sheep. Lindsey who cares for nothing but fame and fortune. Sheep fans. Me, the robot. Business people who care for nothing but money." However, it's not nearly quite so simple, as the basic, boiled down outline stems off into the issues beyond them, growing new stems as new evidence is ascertained. I've not oversimplified Lindsey. I've ascertained quite a good number of things she is, boiled down, a sheep, a liar, a fraud, in some cases, etc, but there are many things branching from the boiled down conclusions I've established, based on things I've noticed. It's impossible, or dimwitted, for me to draw any conclusion I've made based on aesthetic, media-driven nonsense. I've instead gathered most of my conclusions based on Lindsey's own words and actions. If viewed through this perspective, one with an open, non-biased mind can easily come to the series of conclusions I've drawn, but, as we've been over, few have such a willingness, others aren't concerned enough to pay attention, and some are genuinely fooled by her facade. 

    I watched the video, and you seem to have forgotten something crucial. Lindsey is a fantastic liar, and any emotion she expresses, can be faked, much like her plastered on smile during meet-and-greets, giving off the impression she's a "sweetheart," but, in reality, she's playing the game of faces... I can force myself to cry on cue, too. Does it mean I'm genuinely upset? No, it means I'm good at manipulating my body to suite something, although, unlike Lindsey, I have no purpose for such a thing. Lindsey, on the other hand, has a practical purpose for it, and, although she's a terrible actress for a movie, in life, she deserves an Academy Award for faking who she is and how she feels...  

    How exactly would you know she cries if she doesn't feel she's good enough? Do you have proof, a source, being you're always requesting a give you one?﻿

    To answer your request for a source, in her Brave Enough film, Lindsey had something of a meltdown over feeling inadequate as a violinist. It's been a long struggle for her. I haven't read her book, but in researching, I did read a section where she talked about a concert with Andrea Bocelli and other professional musicians a few years ago. She was made to feel pretty terrible about her musicianship, and she was replaced by another violinist for one of her performances. It brought back a lot of old demons. The rise in her skill level over the past few years and the practice that demands is I think directly attributable to how insecure she still feels as a performer. Violin is a scary instrument to play because of how easy it is to play out of tune, and fear of performing can be debilitating at times. Lindsey isn't above that.

    In your second paragraph, you said that if you had oversimplified things, you would not have been able to back up your arguments. I don't think that follows. Offering reasons we believe something does not mean those reasons actually indicate what we believe. In this case, I think you're trying to prove things about Lindsey which may not be true of anyone. I actually feel bad for you, because I think the challenge is unfair to you.

    "I analyze the ways people respond to me, and, if it's more than a single sentence, can draw a profile of their person." "I've instead gathered most of my conclusions based on Lindsey's own words and actions."

    In fairness to you, this isn't all you do, but I'll respond to it anyway. It's the wrong approach, because you have much better data to work with. That data is you. I said before that you should immediately abandon the notion that other people don't experience the same complex emotions you do. You know what being human is like. You experience joy, you experience anger, you experience pain... you don't go through a single day without an unending number of emotions and motivations driving each of your actions. I don't have to listen to what you've told me to understand these things about you, because I know what being human is like. When we try to understand someone, this is the template we should start from. We know Lindsey experiences a crazy world of emotions and motivation, because that's what it is to be human. If you want to know how much Lindsey is driven by money alone, ask yourself how much you are driven by money alone. That will get you in the ballpark. Of course it's also important for us to look at what people do and say, but this should always be carefully applied against what we know about being human. 

    With a "words and actions" approach, it's easy to confirm beliefs we already have. Omission of evidence is one way this happens. From my writing style you concluded I'm dispassionate. But you had a stronger opposing clue, which is simply that I've spent a great deal of time talking to you. We're not going to find an excuse for that which doesn't involve emotional motivation. And really, if you want to understand that emotion, again, you'll do best to start with yourself as a template. Do you care about people? Do you defend people when you know they're unfairly accused? Do you dislike giving up, especially after investing yourself? These are human qualities, and I imagine you share them.

    It's also easy to misinterpret things. You may recall that I've argued musical taste is personal, and musical style and preferences really shouldn't be criticized. You've taken my statements about musical analysis to suggest how I think or feel about music. But if you recall the context, my sentiment there was that we should not attempt to objectively measure the legitimacy of music. When I asked you to analyze Lindsey's music, I wanted to challenge your criticism of it. You listed objective reasons why Lindsey's music was less original than her old music. I wanted to make a point that truly measuring originality requires us to really understanding what we're listening to. If we understand the notes being played and their functional harmony and form, we'll have a much fuller understanding of how unique the music is. Forgive me, but in calling Lindsey's music unoriginal based on the genre it falls into, I thought you were being snooty and speaking out of limited understanding. And so that was me saying, "Okay buddy, you want to go down this path? Let's get real!" :-) I've said before that Lindsey's music has never been terribly unique from a compositional perspective. But I think I can make a pretty good case that it has gotten richer over time, with the latest album continuing that trend. But of course, my ultimate point is still the same - judging it really serves no purpose. We don't need to state objective reasons why music is good or bad to justify how we feel about it. And we shouldn't try to list off objective reasons why people shouldn't like what they like. If a Lindsey Stirling Christmas album becomes a positive thing in some people's lives, then it's a good thing. I'll probably like it, just as I liked Brave Enough. And that will mean my life is slightly better.

    You've analyzed some of Lindsey's words and actions, but you've omitted many things to slant your conclusion. Look at whom she dates, the fact that she dates, the fact that she performs, the fact that she practices, the fact that she cries, the fact that she wears herself out with travel to see her family, the fact that she spends time with friends, the fact that she performs free concerts, the fact that she helps YouTubers who are just getting started, the fact that she plays with Luna, and so on. None of that tallies with caring only about money or fame. You can start with the premise that Lindsey is a human and therefore must feel emotions as strongly as you do. Reinterpret things through that lens. 

    As humans, we understand the feeling that comes from the love and support of others. We can understand the power of that emotion. Only a month after the death of her best friend whom she relied on, with her father sick and everything once solid suddenly upended, we can understand in a video why Lindsey is emotionally distraught but deeply grateful for our steadfast support. That's what it is to be human. And it's the only explanation we need for her tears and words. We would feel the same way. We don't need to invent a Frankenstein to explain this.

    I've explained in absolute terms how Lindsey's actions are helping people. It's irrational to believe Lindsey doesn't realize this or that it plays no part in her decisions. It's irrational because humans like to help people, and we feel good when we do. We can assume that's true of Lindsey. It's illogical to believe that with no real victims of her actions, Lindsey must feel "dirty" and dismiss the good things that come from working with the HP team.

    John, it's an interesting challenge to try to prove that someone cares, but I want to explain where I'm at on this. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I don't honestly see this as a serious question. Does Lindsey care about people, does she love, does she feel... Of course she does. It's a given. It's not something people need to prove about themselves. I've never met anyone who doesn't fit this mold.

    I'm thinking back on some things you've said (and forgive me if I get this wrong) about Lindsey being the one unique person who you thought broke the mold, the one person who really cared. Can we go into what you meant by that? I'd like to understand better. Do you feel as if most people don't really care? If so, what does that mean?﻿

    John Avery Your opinions. I couldn't agree more. Lindsey sold herself unnecessary, she was supposed to be here for the music and the love we share for it. Something meaningful, a diference in the music industry today. But everytime we see, it's just a show more, sad, I never saw her music for her techniques, but for the intentions and courage she used to put on it.﻿

    Ralf, welcome. I appreciate hearing your perspective. If you don't mind, could you please address my first reply to John in this thread? I'd like to hear your impressions of what exactly it is that's wrong with Lindsey working with the people at HP. Why should we consider this work unmeaningful? And who is actually being hurt? I made the case that many people, including you and me, are actually helped by this partnership. Do you have a different perspective that shows someone being hurt? Thanks!﻿

    Ralf Zaitsev: I'm genuinely grateful for the fact you were willing to share a similar mentality on the situation. It's an unfortunate thing, the way she turned out, but fame and money have an effect some people, and the more opportunity for either winds up resulting in the thing she became, the way she goes about her music, and the things she's willing to sell herself out for in order to acquire financial gain. It's a pity. 

    <p>coummunityband1: I'm first going to address the fact many are not willing to spend their time debating with you. It's not some panel... Also, "I think you're trying to prove things about Lindsey which may not be true of anyone." Apparently not... You feel slightly less confident, as a similar opinion to mine sits, written beneath your assumption, which is no longer accurate? Regardless... 

    I've not watched the film, mainly because of the fact it's profit for selfishness, and it's a similar story to the book, which I have read to its entirety, but I needn't watch the film to say to you tears, as I said, can be very easy to manipulate, and a "meltdown" very easily faked. The tears she's likely referring to resulted from an all too familiar feeling to her, embarrassment, not inadequacy, and her "improvement" (certainly not in her ability to create decent music with said "enhanced" violin skills you claim she's developed) has nothing to do with her insecurity, merely improvement with practice, which is required to maintain a command of the instrument. The more you practice, the better you get, simple. 

    The "filler text" you provided in-between your final question, which I'm referring to as "filler text," because a good chunk of it had been discussed in the past, isn't something I felt like answering, but I'll show you the courtesy, because it must've taken you time, not to go to waste by being ignored. 

    "If we understand the notes being played and their functional harmony and form, we'll have a much fuller understanding of how unique the music is."   

    No, not really, not at all, not whatsoever, because, if I was able to name off the chords Lindsey uses, in any of her songs, I'm not going to appreciate them with any greater depth. If you view a sculpture, and you can name the technique used to form the sculpture, it's pointless, because, aside from being trivial knowledge, your only focus should be on the sculpture itself, it's meaning, not if it was created with a bronze or copper chisel... If I listen to Lindsey's music, I feel the way I feel, and knowing the composition of the piece has no effect on feeling or meaning of her music to me. 

    "From my writing style you concluded I'm dispassionate. But you had a stronger opposing clue, which is simply that I've spent a great deal of time talking to you."

    There are plenty of people who spend their time arguing with me for no other sake than being annoyed... You also said you were gaining something from all this, indicating there was some return on your part for the time you put in, and pardon me for thinking you're in this for reasons of a far less noble purpose, but I maintain my stance on the matter in terms of your person... You've not been shy from making conclusions of my person, expect the same thing in return. Plus, I spend my time replying to you, long past the point of anyone else, for no feasible benefit on my side.

    "If you want to know how much Lindsey is driven by money alone, ask yourself how much you are driven by money alone." 

    I'm not... I need it to live, but I would never sell out to a corporation like a sheep, because I was being greedy which seems asinine on your part to challenge me to view it such a way, being you must realize, if I disagree with Lindsey's drive by money, I wouldn't feel the same way... 

    "Look at whom she dates, the fact that she dates, the fact that she performs, the fact that she practices, the fact that she cries, the fact that she wears herself out with travel to see her family, the fact that she spends time with friends, the fact that she performs free concerts, the fact that she helps YouTubers who are just getting started, the fact that she plays with Luna, and so on. None of that tallies with caring only about money or fame. You can start with the premise that Lindsey is a human and therefore must feel emotions as strongly as you do. Reinterpret things through that lens." 

    We've been over this, the fans, fame, and family nonsense, how she prioritizes them, how much she cares about them, and all that. You're going around in circles... It's probably in the binder you have of all my past arguments... Do give it a going over... 

    The final question, the one with actual non-repetitive legitimacy: 

    "Can we go into what you meant by that? I'd like to understand better.Do you feel as if most people don't really care? If so, what does that mean?" 

    If I had any one bit of trust in you, if I wasn't smart enough to have learned being any kind of emotionally deep with you wouldn't come back in some way or another, I would elaborate on this question, but time and time again, you've warped things like those in future arguments. Therefore, it seems folly to answer...﻿

    You continue to defend your views by skipping over things you don't like to address. We have the "corporate sheep" catch phrase here again. You haven't really answered my very first reply on this thread. Why is it wrong for Lindsey to help the people at HP? Who is an actual victim of this? You wrote words about how you chose to feel about things, but you didn't actually answer these questions. There is no good reason for Lindsey to agree with your feeling that something is wrong unless you can show something tangible beyond how you choose to feel. You've decided that it is wrong for her to work with HP to raise money. But what is the solid basis for your decision? Who has been hurt?

    What I interpret from your statements is that people whom you don't know don't get much space in your calculations. The people at HP are part of a company and as such are easy to dismiss as a group. You don't know them, and therefore their challenges don't concern you. The things they spend their lives working on are of no interest or value to you and really don't matter. It's irrelevant that to survive, they need to share their work with people, and they need to reach their audience where its attention is given.

    I fully understand that you are not alone in thinking this way. But it's a product of shallow thinking. I showed objectively how everyone is helped by this partnership, including you and me. If Lindsey is objective, she will decide to do this, because she will help herself and help others. Nobody actually gets hurt. The most negative thing that can be said is that she'll upset some people who decide not to like it. Fearing that some people will irrationally choose to not like something is not a good enough reason on its own to not do it.

    "You feel slightly less confident, as a similar opinion to mine sits, written beneath your assumption, which is no longer accurate?"

    Perhaps you misunderstood? I stated that you're trying to prove something about Lindsey that may not be true of any human on the planet. I think it's biologically impossible for someone to have such simplistic cares and motivations. It's also self-contradictory. Fame itself is not an emotion. People who care about fame care about what people think of them, and that by itself is an extremely complex emotion with many tangents. It touches more than a little on something most of us feel. In saying Lindsey desires fame, what we're really saying is that she desires approval from others. And when we desire approval from others, it's typically because we don't feel entirely adequate on our own. Desiring approval from others also implies caring about others' opinions. If we didn't care about what people think, fame would have no value to us.

    "No, not really, not at all, not whatsoever, because, if I was able to name off the chords Lindsey uses, in any of her songs, I'm not going to appreciate them with any greater depth."

    But we aren't talking about appreciation. This is about objectively determining how unique Lindsey's music is. The words "unique" and "original" imply comparison. Studying a subject improves our ability to discern similarities and differences. Your basis for saying her music is less original was a comparison to other music. I challenged you to take that comparison further. As a composer, Lindsey deals in melody, harmony, chord progressions, form, production, and so on. Comparing how she approaches these things to the direction taken by other artists is a very legitimate measure of how original her work is. It's more substantial than saying, "This is pop." After all, if genre was the best measure of originality, there wouldn't be many original songs in the world.

    "You've not been shy from making conclusions of my person, expect the same thing in return."

    But you haven't given the same in return. My descriptions of you all matched standard human emotions. I've said that I believe you post in part to receive positive affirmation in the form of likes. Seeking affirmation puts you with virtually any human on the planet. You've displayed indications of other human-like emotions, such as embarrassment, which reinforce that you are human and care about the reactions people have to you. I've said I think you feel tied into this endeavor because of your effort so far. It would be very inhuman of you to not feel threatened by this entire discussion. People base their self-image heavily on things they invest themselves in, feel they are good at, or make them unique. I would guess that you likely felt some satisfaction in noticing changes in Lindsey's posting behavior if you believed other people didn't pick up on them. That would be very human and understandable, because it would affirm intelligence and uniqueness. The thought of being wrong and also having played your cards so fully in public could feel threatening. It could make us continue to try to convince ourselves as much as anyone else that we are right. You can potentially feel less loss in Lindsey being what you've said than in being wrong. That's human nature.

    If you try to characterize me as someone who doesn't feel various things, you'll associate with me with behavior that's atypical of humans. That's a different approach. I'm starting with the assumption that you're more like me than not.

    "We've been over this, the fans, fame, and family nonsense..."

    But you've never explained them. I'm under the impression you deleted the thread where we started to discuss this angle, and questions like these went unanswered. You accuse Lindsey of being motivated by only fame and fortune, so I think you should accept the burden of explaining anything she does which does not seem to fit with that. I’ll start with these.

    1. Why is Lindsey in a serious relationship with someone, and why doesn’t she date someone wealthy if money trumps love?
    2. Why did Lindsey travel back to see her father between every tour destination?
    3. Why does Lindsey play with her dog?
    4. Why does Lindsey hang out with friends and family?
    5. Why has Lindsey attended therapy recently?

    If you feel you have answered these, please feel free to copy and paste your answers. 

    Here's where we stand. I will answer any questions you have which you believe force us to conclude Lindsey cares only for money and fame. I'm asking for your best shot. But please don't step away from my challenges. You stopped defending your corporation argument in this thread. Come back to it if you like, and we'll discuss it. But please don't just throw in little "corporate sheep" asides as if that's still solid ground. Either show how this partnership really causes harm beyond how you choose to feel, or drop it. It just doesn't work to say, "Lindsey's a corporate sheep because she partners with a company, and the result is everyone benefits." Until you demonstrate otherwise, the only "sheep-like" behavior here is the idea that we must accept pop-culture thinking about advertising and companies. Show me you can think outside the box on this and really defend your perspective.

    What do you feel is your best proof Lindsey cares only for fame and money?﻿

    "I'm not... I need it to live, but I would never sell out to a corporation like a sheep..."  I really do not admire this mentality. The only reason we are able to have this discussion is because people with big ideas came together to work as teams in businesses. We're communicating with tools created by people who worked together. We're communicating through a platform that only exists because brilliant people dreamed up the idea and had the determination to make it happen as a team. We're alive today because people worked together on ideas that advanced medical science. Without their work, we wouldn't even exist. It is wrong to belittle millions of people who work with and for corporations and devote themselves to their jobs. We haven't lived a single day of our entire lives without the benefits that come from people working together as part of corporate teams. I've worked for corporations, and it enabled me to do things I never could have done alone. I invented ideas and worked hundreds of unpaid hours to change the direction and success of an entire company. Teams don't need or want sheep. They need people who apply their creativity to solve problems and support each other.

    If you really view working with or as part of a corporation as being a sheep, then I agree, you shouldn't do it. Teams need bright people who work not only for money but who embrace a mission. If you don't believe in a team's mission, you should not take their money, because you'll never have the motivation required to give your best effort.

    I just went and listened to some interviews with Dion Weisler, CEO of HP inc. I admire him. He's a man who not only has vision, but who also fully dives into the work it takes to make ideas a reality. He doesn't sit at the top and take in the money while others do the hard work (as if that's even how corporate profits work). According to Glassdoor, he has an 83% approval rating among HP employees. You don't earn respect like that by being evil or treating people like sheep.

    I wouldn't hesitate to work with HP. That team has its eye on using 3D printing to revolutionize how manufacturing is done, making it affordable for the masses. Their innovation can enable the innovation of thousands... maybe millions. That's cool. That's how tomorrow gets better for all of us. I want Lindsey to support this team.﻿

    communityband1: "You haven't really answered my very first reply on this thread.Why is it wrong for Lindsey to help the people at HP? Who is an actual victim of this?" 

    Yet, I have, in the past, to which you provided me some nonsense and completely skirted around another portion of my response, but it's no longer available, because, for some reason, the entire discussion was removed, likely too many people reporting it as spam... I'll say this one more time. You're going around in circles, forgetting things you've been provided an answer to in the past, and, even though it's no longer a visible comment chain, it's no excuse for you to forget it existed... 

    "In saying Lindsey desires fame, what we're really saying is that she desires approval from others." 

    No, she feels the need to fulfill her ego. If you listen to her past interviews, she's admitted her desire is for nothing less than to get attention, not for approval.  

    "After all, if genre was the best measure of originality, there wouldn't be many original songs in the world." 

    The genre of pop doesn't define uniqueness, as many pieces throughout history have fallen into this genre, and they are still unique to this day. However, the point I'm trying to make, but you seem to have confused with me saying the genre itself is the issue, is the fact modern pop music utilizes the same awful sounds, causing this era to be deemed as one of the worst for musical diversity and expression. Lindsey's original two albums didn't fit this mold, because they utilized different sounds than the trite ones we're becoming saturated with currently. Brave Enough does use the same, overused, crummy sounds of modern pop, and therefore it's not unique. It's overused. As a comparison to help you, if everyone wears the same hat as me, I'm not unique. If i wear a different hat, I'm unique, because it's different. It's not the matter of me wearing a hat, it's the style of the hat making me different. So, it's not the genre itself, only the fact there's no diversity in the genre. When I say generic pop garbage, I'm referring to the overused sounds in pop, not pop itself. If you still aren't getting the reason her music isn't unique, with the clearest explanation I can give, there's no helping you...

    My judgement of your person falls into the category of standard human emotions, only lacking them. As I mentioned, you appear to be devoid of expressing standard human emotions in your writing and come off as a computer. I've had little trouble, all be it overwhelmingly in the past, expressing something other than  information regurgitation with no inflection of any emotions. You're the exact opposite, in the respect you haven't expressed anything but aloof replies, which has led me to my conclusion you're apathetic.  

    I'll restate the same thing, which is, for some reason, the entire discussion was removed, likely too many people reporting it as spam, but those areas, in one way or another, were answered, and I'm not going to retype something which already existed but was removed...

    What do you feel is your best proof Lindsey cares only for fame and money? 

    ... How many times must I say you're going in circles? What have you even been reading in the past? If you remember anything, you would realize we've been over this so many times, accomplished nothing, and I'd reached the conclusion rationalizing this with you was impossible... It's the same as the corporate sheep angle. We've been over the same thing in the past, to have reached a similar conclusion. I know I said this exact same thing in the past. 

    "I really do not admire this mentality." 

    What mentality? Reality? No, I'd imagine you wouldn't...  You say about this platform. This platform was started by 3 people, not a building's worth of them... You say I devalue millions. It's hard to devalue any person working for the same thing, feeding a corporation, for some person to become rich, and most of those beneath him/her to make money for survival, but fulfilling nothing worth mentioning. If you search throughout human history, you'll never find anything about "Joe, the guy who sat behind a computer, punching in numbers all day, every single day, getting a paycheck, to support his unfulfilled life." What is a sheep? It's an animal, being used for it's wool, for someone else, or meat, for someone else, being told to move here and there, by someone else, like the rest of its kind. What is a person working for a corporation? A person being told to perform something, by someone else, for the benefit of someone else. Lindsey is slightly different in the sense she isn't working directly for them, but worse, because she gets told to do something and, as opposed to thinking her art and person are more important, she'll listen to them, for money. Either mentality is a sheep, but Lindsey doesn't need the corporation to survive, only bows down to them, because she feels like she needs more money. I've said this, too. If you offer her enough money, her "standards" are non-existent, and she'll do pretty much anything a corporation sees fit for her, dye her hair, mess up her videos, and I'm waiting for the day she completely abandons her self-respect and poses for a swimsuit issue for money...﻿

    I don't want you to repeat yourself, but I'm hoping for more complete answers to many questions and initial answers to others. Regarding whom Lindsey's partnership affects negatively, I think the most you've offered is that people who choose to purchase advertised products are making a mistake. Is that your answer? The idea of withholding information from people because we deem them incapable of making decisions for themselves seems to me like a road we should not go down. 

    Can you please share the source where Lindsey says she desires nothing in life besides attention? Thanks. And which sounds in pop music do you identify as unique to pop and "awful?" Do you feel that a composer's originality is largely dependent on instrument selection? Regarding your hat analogy, I would say instead that someone judging your originality solely by your hat might misunderstand what it means to be unique. It is similarly unreasonable to measure the originality of music by a single aspect rather than all of its parts. The work that goes into composing and the opportunity for originality goes far beyond sound selection.

    I understand you think it's possible for me to lack emotions. I also understand you may not yet see why I as an older adult should behave calmly in this discussion. If we stood together and had this conversation, we'd see a young guy arguing life with a man. This is not a situation where I should feel compelled to overreact.

    Corporate profits don't go to management, but to the owners. The public owns HP, and when HP is successful, the profits enrich HP's public shareholders. Those who risk the most in owning shares of HP are rewarded the most when it succeeds and suffer the most when it fails. If you work for a corporation and want to share in its profits, buy its stock. Corporations and stocks are actually recognized to help distribute wealth across society.

    My experience doesn't match your impression of the corporate atmosphere. Many companies afford a great deal of flexibility to their employees, often to the point of defining their own roles. Good employees know how to operate autonomously and look for opportunities to help without being instructed. Companies look for individuals who show this behavior and reward them. I've witnessed this throughout my career and have experienced it myself.

    I don't see where you've provided Lindsey a mature reason to feel shame. Nothing you've said makes me feel guilty for my views. In her place, I would feel ashamed to bow to pressure when I know that I'm doing things that help my team and society. Moreover, I see a moral need to help people separate fact from fiction. We're bombarded with one-sided thinking on business and money. There absolutely are people who do evil things for money, and corporate leaders face great pressure at times to compete with people who do immoral things. But thinking of corporations as a whole as evil or the pursuit of mutual gain as evil when both have created such great advances for humanity is a terrible mistake. We have people in our government who seek power by spreading this narrow thinking, and they block progress that makes lives better or even saves lives. That's wrong. We need to challenge people to think critically and demand that they move away from stereotypical thinking. We can punish the things that are bad and embrace the things that are good. And everything Lindsey is doing here is good.﻿

    communityband1: Yes, I realize there's a extremely obnoxious, stringent filter on Lindsey's account only, as I have seen far worse being left unnoticed on different accounts, making this particular conversation difficult, as many points of reason on my part have been unnecessarily muted for a single word, or entirely removed. Regardless, we're stuck with the issue we're dealt with, and there's nothing to be done, minus "dumbing" the argument down, editing out valid rationale on both sides, I imagine. 

    Why not? If you've noticed, there are a good many people so enamored with Lindsey, they'll buy something if it's related to her, in any way. So, let's have people waste money on an unneeded item, because it's endorsed by Lindsey. It's taking advantage of people's admiration for her and using it selfishly. 

    Okay, and here's proof you warped my words. 

    You offered this logic: "In saying Lindsey desires fame, what we're really saying is that she desires approval from others."

    I replied with, "No, she feels the need to fulfill her ego. If you listen to her past interviews, she's admitted her desire is for nothing less than to get attention, not for approval." 

    Where in any of that did I say, or even imply, "Lindsey says she desires nothing IN LIFE besides attention?" I didn't. I presented an argument to your logic it's the reason she desires fame. 

    Regardless, I couldn't provide you with the exact interviews, being I've watched so many in the past, and the segment would be far too minuscule to give you an exact time. I simply remember a good many things she has said in the past, because she came off as intelligent and well worth listening to for insight. I'm not even boiling it down to an individual part... The music i.e. the beat, the rhythm, the synthetic sound, the dime-store lyrics, the violin being choked by both of them, etc... make Lindsey's current music awful. 

    I think you're under some grandiose illusion I'm a child... I'm likely not older than you, I'd imagine, but there's certainly not a significant enough gap for you to be making it sound like you should be speaking to me as if I was an adolescent... Also, very nice excuse for you simply being expressionless and cold... You also seem to forget it's the circumstances of one's life which establishes their life experience. You could be eighty and have a silver spoon life, knowing nothing of real life. Conversely, you could be a teen and have been through the worst, giving you plenty more experience than the eighty-year-old. Do step down from your high horse. I find your pretentiousness sickening, as I'm betting you lack a good deal of life experience, especially in the places I have plenty...  

    Yes, the people, the general masses profit... What world do you live in and how can I get on a one-way ticket there? There are plenty of examples of employee mistreatment in bigger corporations. Do you live in the same world as me, or do you binge on positive videos, as opposed to the real ones, about things like these? Seriously, you sound like an 80's training tape for new employees... 

    Your last part of this... aren't you deluded... I've not presented anything to give off the impression Lindsey should feel guilty, nor you? Well, you're easy, because you feel no guilt from anything I present to you, ego playing a major role. Lindsey, the sheep, based on things I've witnessed, has plenty to feel guilty over, but she's so wrapped up in getting more fame and making more money, morality and standards are the least of her concern. You would be amazed how low she would sink for either of those things. Whatever sense of better judgement I thought she had flew out the window the day I realized she was as shallow as a puddle in the middle of a desert, during a sandstorm, after a month-long drought, in August... You want some side note information? She supports the screwed up government we have, as evidence by her posts, and the completely screwed up views she has on equality. If she can think with such close-minded opinions, you think she's going to feel guilty over anything I say? You must be living on another planet...﻿

    Your answer is off on at least two counts. First, the overwhelming odds are that nobody has purchased a Sprocket with only the intent to support Lindsey. You've offered no evidence of it, and it is up to you to prove otherwise. Anyone wishing to give Lindsey money is aware of far more direct avenues, and paying money to HP would do almost nothing to benefit Lindsey. Second, if your hypothetical human exists and believes that purchasing a Sprocket is an act of kindness he cares more about than money, then the money is well-traded for him. He gets the satisfaction he pays for. Your argument is that people should not decide what is best for themselves, and that's wrong. We are uniquely qualified to understand our own situations and the merits of our choices. I can also point out that a Sprocket retains value after purchase. Your hypothetical person would be free to resell the device, and given that it has been in high demand, often sold out, it would not be difficult to do so.

    If this is truly your answer for whom this partnership hurts, your complaint is unwarranted. I’ve explained how this partnership benefits everyone. You argue that Lindsey should abandon it because someone could hypothetically decide to do something kind for Lindsey and the people at HP in response. That doesn’t work.

    "Where in any of that did I say, or even imply, 'Lindsey says she desires nothing IN LIFE besides attention?'"

    Where exactly do you assume Lindsey operates, if not in life? You are telling us that there is an interview out there where Lindsey admits that she doesn't care about approval. When I said that she seeks approval, your first word was "No." Please don't be lazy. Go back and find the proof of this accusation. I don't believe it exists. I do not believe Lindsey has ever given an interview where she "admits" that she cares only for attention and cares nothing about approval. I think you're taking words out of context, and I ask that you prove your statement. We should note that seeking attention and seeking approval are hardly mutually exclusive. People typically seek positive attention, which implies approval.

    "The music i.e. the beat, the rhythm, the synthetic sound, the dime-store lyrics, the violin being choked by both of them, etc... make Lindsey's current music awful. "

    You offer nothing specific. There is no rhythm in pop music that doesn't exist abundantly in other genres. Synth drums and pads are used across many genres. Furthermore, between the various vocal tracks in the Brave Enough album, there's not a ton of overlap in these things. Are you bothered by accents on weak beats? Finger snaps are used in more than one song. Does that make a composition seem unoriginal to you? This is really basic stuff we're talking about here. Anybody can pick a drum loop out of a library (and my impression is this constitutes the majority of what you're describing). Originality lies much more with what we create to go along with that. As far as the lyrics go, I think it's ironic that you complain I'm unemotional while saying that you feel less emotion and deep meaning from this album than I do. Perhaps you and Lindsey just have different ways of seeing things.

    "I think you're under some grandiose illusion I'm a child..."

    I've been hoping you are late teens, though you referred to teenagers once, and that gave me the impression you could be 20 or 21. I've worked with a lot of young people, and I know that people change pretty dramatically from 18 to 30. Perspective changes a lot with each stage of life. And regardless of the merits of experience, there is also no substitute for time. I don't believe it's a coincidence that you do not see older people attacking Lindsey continually. Age will likely change your mind about how appropriate this is.

    "There are plenty of examples of employee mistreatment in bigger corporations."

    I addressed this before you said it. It's arguing we should dislike corporations because some corporations do bad things. We could use the same logic to justify destroying the human race. Are there corporations that do bad things or mistreat their employees? Are there individuals within good companies who create a negative experience? Of course there are. But dismissing corporations in general because of a few bad actors is silly. Today I looked through comments made by HP employees. The vibe overall is positive, and there are many accounts of people pleased with how they're treated and pleased with the opportunities for advancement. The things I'm saying about the benefits of corporations to our world and the experience many people have working for them are common knowledge. 

    "I've not presented anything to give off the impression Lindsey should feel guilty, nor you?"

    No, you haven't. Lindsey is helping people, and because this also helps her, you say it's wrong. Logic and emotion each have their place in this world. But emotions which lead us to decisions that stand in the way of helping ourselves and others may be harmful. You ask for something that takes things away from all of us, but you do not explain why it's necessary. Logic tells me not to follow you.

    You've suggested at times that Lindsey makes enough money, and this should be reason not to pursue more. This type of thinking would have held society back a great deal. Most of what we know and rely on today was invented by people pushing their success as far as it could go.

    I think it's key to remember that we are compensated for our service. Service - the act of helping people. The opportunities Lindsey has for additional compensation come through service to others. If we argue that Lindsey should say enough is enough, we argue that at some point it becomes possible that a person's service is no longer a good thing. History has taught us differently.

    It is human nature to build. People want to feel progress in their lives and feel they are moving forward and achieving new things. Lindsey demonstrates this. Money does not stick to her, as we might expect if money was an ultimate goal. The more money she makes, the more money she spends to do bigger things. Like the rest of us, Lindsey seeks to grow.﻿

    As you can see from 71 likes on the original post, and the sheep comments beneath it, people are willing to purchase something for Lindsey only, in this case the game she was sponsored by, RiMe. You can't dispute my claim of these people purchasing something solely for Lindsey any longer. These people exist, accept it.

    the girl who was singing basically ruined the whole violin alone music. -_-

    As you can see once more, people agree with my claims of the vocals ruining her music. 

    First you said, "Fame itself is not an emotion. People who care about fame care about what people think of them, and that by itself is an extremely complex emotion with many tangents. It touches more than a little on something most of us feel. In saying Lindsey desires fame, what we're really saying is that she desires approval from others." 

    My reply was: "No, she feels the need to fulfill her ego. If you listen to her past interviews, she's admitted her desire is for nothing less than to get attention, not for approval." 

    You return with, "Can you please share the source where Lindsey says she desires nothing in life besides attention?" 

    My reply to your claim was Lindsey desires fame for the I reason gave, never implying she only desires attention in her life, only in her career, which her fame is associated. You took it on yourself to make an assumption I said her life revolves around attention. Therefore, you warped the topic. 

    If you think age determines my views on Lindsey, you're mistaken... simple as that... 

    My views on corporations are shared by many, and it's your opinion they are all fluffy and wonderful... 

    Lindsey does not seek to grow, only be greedy. You present a far too flattering side of her mentality. 

    Okay, let's go into your curiosity...

    "Perfect equality would mandate that we hold some back from pursuing their greatest potential." Lindsey Stirling 

    What? So, you're implying people shouldn't be perfectly equal, because it would hold them back? How, in any way, is that logically sound or morally decent?﻿

    Okay, well unfortunately I haven't heard back yet from SilverSong27 or Sapphire Elf. I have to say, I'm not impressed with your willingness to publicly slander people on such flimsy grounds without paying them the slightest courtesy of asking them. It very much fits my impression of the standard of evidence you've applied for your conclusions about Lindsey.

    From my own research, I'm certain you're wrong about these people. I focused on SilverSong27 and Sapphire Elf because these were the two who made comments you could most easily twist. Now the first thing I'll say is that the only proper means to do this research is to ask them. We still have far too little to go on. For example, we don't know whether either of them bought this game. I could find no evidence in their other comments that they have. It goes without saying that the question of "why" they bought the game is pointless if in fact they didn't buy it. But since I'm not stating words which may demean them, I will go ahead and offer what I see.

    SilverSong27 appears to be an avid gamer. Her Twitter account is full of tweets about games, and from the genres and art styles she seems to like, we may guess why she was drawn to RiME. The most direct clue we have of her interest is that she follows RiME on Twitter. So immediately we know that she had interest in this game beyond supporting Lindsey. Now, as far as being a Lindsey Stirling fan, it's a safe bet that she likes her. She subscribes to her main channel here on YouTube and has Liked a total of four of Lindsey's videos over the last 5 years. She also follows Lindsey on Twitter, though she does not seem to actively retweet her. She has not liked any of the LindseyTime videos, which makes it seem she isn't quite a big enough fan to subscribe to her there. All in all, I see no evidence to suggest SilverSong27 exhibits the level of fandom you were hoping to find. I think a far better guess is that she was interested in this game, perhaps before seeing Lindsey promote it, and when learning that an artist she likes worked on music for the game, she wrote the comment you quoted. Whether she carried through on the plan is unknown. In any case, she shows more interest in games than Lindsey Stirling. And she appears much less attached to Lindsey than you are.

    Sapphire Elf is a legit Lindsey fan and has subscribed to both her main channel and LindseyTime. She is a violinist herself and enjoys Lindsey's music, including her latest album. But her quote shows a huge problem for your interpretation - she played Child of Light, and she wants to play RiME. If her intent is only to support Lindsey, there's no need to play these games. Moreover, she really liked Child of Light, to the point that she went out and asked people if they could recommend other games that were similar to it. What I'm left to guess here is that Lindsey helped her discover these games, but she chose to purchase Child of Light because she wanted to play it, and she really loved it. And that's exactly how advertising is supposed to work. I can find no confirmation that she ever played RiME. For what it's worth, her name "Sapphire Elf" also appears to be a reference to a different music group she follows, so I'm not altogether sure that Lindsey is her favorite musician.

    Mind you, if you truly believe I'm wrong, then I invite you to put some money on it. We can certainly arrange a transaction that doesn't involve divulging personal details, and I'm sure we can eventually find a way to reach these people to learn the truth. Are you up for it?

    "We'll continue with my claim of Lindsey's music becoming stale to several people."

    You can point to people who don't like Lindsey's album. I can easily point to people who like it as well. But we have more objective ways of doing this. The Brave Enough album has received positive consumer reviews overall, averaging 4.5 stars on Amazon. I was also able to discover seven published professional reviews, and each was positive. Here are a few clips:

    "Lindsey Stirling's third album, Brave Enough, is where her crossover sound falls nicely into place. Her first two efforts -- thrilling collisions of violin acrobatics and electronic embellishment -- were novel, but there was something missing to that new age dubstep. On Brave Enough, Stirling taps into a deep well of pain -- inspired by her own emotional maturity and the death of her best friend and keyboardist, Jason Gaviati, in November 2015 -- and the result is an organic interplay between her instrument and digital beats that focuses more on pleasant rhythms than dubstep muscle. Each song is a step through the processing of pain, an emotional roller coaster that finds Stirling on a journey to face the darkness and find a way to carry on."

    "The album is split between Stirling’s solo tracks carried by her creative violin melodies, and songs with contributions by a guest vocalist, more of a rarity in her earlier days. The violin replaces where the dance breakdown would typically be in an EDM song, therefore still allowing her to have a prominent presence on these songs. Neither half rises over the other, as the main draw to the album is without question Stirling’s dexterity with her instrument which is featured heavily regardless. The guest vocalists never outshine her, instead complementing nicely, many of the soft-spoken indie variety. Christina Perri’s turn on “Brave Enough” and country duo Dan + Shays’s “Those Days” deserve special recognition, although the fact that a song now exists which features an EDM violinist, a Christian rapper (Lecrae) and the frontman of Weezer is quite remarkable (Don’t Let This Feeling Fade)."

    "That heart is central to what makes Brave Enough so successful: it's not just about cool crossover sounds anymore, it's about hitting that emotional target. Stirling and company pull it off quite nicely and Brave Enough ends up being one of her most listenable, enjoyable, and emotionally satisfying efforts."

    "The added variety was a surprising change from her past albums and a welcome one, too. Looking back, her first self-titled album had songs that tended to blend together. More often than not, I was able to differentiate “Crystallize” or “Minimal Beat”, but there were still those off chances. That’s all changed though. Fast and slow tempo songs are included, as well as additional instruments-the heavy influence of electronic music was slowly weeded out, but enough has remained to help her retain her original identity. “The Arena” is a prime example of this, as is “The Phoenix”."

    However, in all of this, you need to understand something. I don't claim that Brave Enough is as popular as Lindsey's previous albums. My argument is that popularity tells us nothing of originality. It is predictable that some who enjoyed Lindsey's older music would be less drawn to different styles. People glorify familiarity in music much more than originality. This new album brought in new people who were never much interested in her old music, and at the same time, it turned away some people who really liked the first two albums. This is not about originality or quality. It is simply about what people like.

    "What? So, you're implying people shouldn't be perfectly equal, because it would hold them back? How, in any way, is that logically sound or morally decent?"

    Lindsey's entire statement was, "We have the freedom to create our own destiny. Perfect equality would mandate that we hold some back from pursuing their greatest potential."

    Her meaning seems obvious and uncontroversial. Forcing people to be the same, ie. equal, would take away their freedom to create their own destiny. People are not equal, but unique. Treating people equally under our laws and forcing people to actually be equal are very different concepts. The discussion you pulled this quote from featured both concepts. One person was talking about treating people fairly, and the other was making a philosophical argument that we're much better off taking advantage of the things that make us unique. Lindsey rephrased the philosophical point, perhaps to help the first person understand where the second was coming from. All in all, it was a bit silly, because the person making the philosophical argument almost certainly understood where the confusion lay and could have been nice enough to explain or just let it go. They were effectively both right. We don't want people to be the same. But we do need to treat people with equal fairness.

    "My reply to your claim was Lindsey desires fame for the I reason gave, never implying she only desires attention in her life, only in her career, which her fame is associated."

    "I feel my heart racing, I see the faces in the audience smiling, and I remember the moment I thought, 'I have to make this my life.'" - Lindsey Stirling

    You imply a disparity where none exists. Our career is part of our life, and in a career like Lindsey's, it is essential to love what you do. A "this-is-just-my-job" mentality could never provide the motivation it takes to work as hard as she does. It was her passion for these things that created her career.

    In any case though, I still welcome you to provide video proof that she only desires attention in any aspect of her life.﻿

    communityband1: First off, stop liking your posts, as no one else could possibly be this involved to have waited an entire week for your reply, to like it within a day. I'll further go on to say, the comments I provided were posted publicly on Lindsey's videos, and thus were fair to mention, as anyone in view of the videos could've seen them. Therefore, they're not required for any permission on my part. The disturbing part of this is your bizarre mentality, believing it's not the slightest bit off, attempting to contact these people, as if they had some knowledge of this entire thing, and, even if you explained the situation, they wouldn't find it creepy some mid-aged person is trying to speak to them about this, too. Furthermore, the justification for your action is not valid, as I didn't slander their names, merely mentioned the posts in support of my claims, and the amount of time you've spent looking into these particular people is both unsettling and warped, as they are not public figures, like Lindsey, which you should respect the two of them enough to understand the distinction. You should also have the commonsense to realize they likely want no part of this, especially with the two having not said anything on any of my past comments, to which you would've had a sliver of rationale, if it had been the case. I'm both sickened by your inconsiderate behavior and vexed by your own morality. I'll take a brief moment to mention your childish behavior, suggesting a bet, as if this were a game. I'd say you were being sarcastic, but it's obvious you weren't... You've reduced your own credibility in a single response. Bravo... This further supports my claim, you are callous and unfeeling for the emotions of others, failing to notice the reality of your disturbed behavior towards them. Lindsey is a public figure, a celebrity, as such, she has opened herself to the judgement of her character. It comes with the territory, especially given the impact she has on her fans. You're demonstrating the very characteristics you've accused me of in the past, but lacking the justification for your actions, whereas I have justification for mine. I'm clearly a better judge of morality than you give me credit for, as I nailed yours down to a science, like I have with Lindsey's morality. You draw your logic from nonsense theory, favoring your side, (sheep logic) and personal opinion,  bias for Lindsey, not against, like mine, but typically yours is flimsier and far less realistic. Do join the real world, and you'll have some credibility to counter me, but, while you're still in fantasy land, I see little reason to believe my judgement of Lindsey, given all I've acquired, and you've done little to reason away, isn't perfectly sound.﻿

    People receive email notifications of comments, so the most likely time a comment will receive a Like is when that email is first seen. I think it's a fair guess that most people still check email daily, especially with mobile device notifications. In any case, you're mistaken.

    "...your bizarre mentality..."

    My thinking is quite simple. I ask myself what I would want someone else to do for me. If someone quoted me publicly and spun my meaning a way that degraded me unfairly, would I appreciate someone telling me about it and defending me? Yes. I very much want to know if someone is putting out public comments against me behind my back. I deserve a chance to put the record straight. I feel confident that most people agree with me. Should we start a poll?

    "Furthermore, the justification for your action is not valid, as I didn't slander their names, merely mentioned the posts in support of my claims..."

    You stated their words mean that they bought these games for no reason other than to support Lindsey, and your intent was to prove that they are incapable of making intelligent decisions for themselves. You referred to them as sheep, which you described as animals. You didn't just quote these people. You took their words, presented your own interpretation of their meaning as undeniable fact, and used that to degrade them.

    I didn't challenge you to back your claims with substance because I seriously believed you would do it. If you were unwise enough to do so, I would certainly honor it. But my intent was to determine whether you actually believe what you're saying. With or without money, I don't think you'd shy away from a real chance to prove me wrong if you felt sure proof would fall on your side. I therefore do not believe that you actually feel confident in what you're saying, and that's one of the reasons I believe what you are doing is wrong. I've already said that accusations against a person's character should demand a high standard of proof. 

    I expected you to react angrily when you learned that I shared your statements about these people with them. That's a human reaction.

    You seem confused about some of the particulars of defamation law. Lindsey's status as a celebrity increases her burden of proof for a defamation suit against you, but it does not remove this protection. 

    To win a defamation lawsuit, Lindsey would need to prove the following:

    1. Someone made a written or spoken statement.
    2. That statement was published and seen by a third party. Social media counts for this.
    3. The statement caused injury to her reputation.
    4. The statement was false and was made with the knowledge that it either was false or there was a reasonable possibility that it was false.
    5. The statement did not fall into a privileged category, such as witness testimony in a trial.
    6. As a celebrity, Lindsey would have the additional responsibility of proving actual malicious intent. In other words, she would have to prove you intended to damage her reputation.

    Now, to be certain, I believe the odds Lindsey will sue you for defamation are zero. I don't think she cares enough to even try. But if we look back at your written comments, we can actually make a case for all of these. You've openly stated that you intend to damage her reputation, and that's the one additional thing a public figure needs to prove. You've also openly acknowledged, when you were less angry, that you aren't sure you're right. These words you wrote previously could be drawn as evidence, "...and I'm left with a mess of benefit of the doubt versus my suspicions, both backed up on either side."

    We do not have unlimited freedom to defame a person just because of celebrity status. The barrier is higher, but we're still required to treat people humanely. 

    "If you want to be sure you are not exposed to a lawsuit for defamation, you should always be certain that what you say on the internet is either true or wholly your own opinion. If you are not sure about something, do not state it as a fact. In addition, do not disguise a statement of fact as your opinion. Saying “I think…” or “It is my opinion that…John Doe is the one who robbed the bank” will not protect you from a lawsuit. Even if you know what you are saying is true, think about how you would prove it. It is often expensive and time-consuming to prove that something is true. Though it is completely legal to exercise your first amendment right to free speech, it is also good to abide by the following rule: if you wouldn’t say it to the person’s face, don’t say it on the internet."﻿

    If Lindsey had put up a video for her getting a new million subscribers, even if it was concise, a minute or two in length, I would've thought she cared. Do you think that would've been hard? If Lindsey had put up some covers here and there, without them being sponsored, in-between her big budget ones, and kept her behind the scenes stuff on LindseyTime, which she always used to do prior to this year, I wouldn't have thought she was being lazy or view hunting. Does that seem too difficult? 

    If Lindsey posted about her merchandise once, or a few times, as long as it within a reasonable amount of time between, and she posted normal stuff more than advertisements, I wouldn't have thought she was money obsessed. Does that seem odd? 

    If Lindsey communicated with her fans, not the same five, and not with some advertisement following up, even if it was once in a two weeks, for a minute, maybe pressed the like button for a few posts on each YouTube video, like 90% of YouTube stars or beginners will, I wouldn't think she stopped caring. Does that seem like too much of an expectation? 

    If Lindsey had worked with any corporation, but she hadn't fused their stuff into her videos to the point it became the sole focus, instead mentioned them in the outro or intro, provided a link, like she did in every earlier video, I wouldn't have thought she sold out. Does that seem off? If she had dyed her hair, not like I wouldn't have thought it looked worse on her, but she didn't do it for something so sheepish, I would've thought, "it's not the best look for your hair, and red looked nicer, more unique, but it's yours, and it's not mine, you're still Lindsey," and I wouldn't have pointed out it showed off her wrinkles sightly more, too, a realization many people have noticed. Does that not make sense? 

    If Lindsey hadn't made every music video some bizarre, overly-produced, and meaningless thing, reduced the collabs a little bit, so it wasn't half the stinking album, and then gone straight into making the most overused music in the history of music, a Christmas album, I would've been patient, admiring the first two albums, assuming she was going to create something different for her fourth, not generic pop again, being there are several other genres to explore, not even expecting another dub-step album, but eagerly awaited something new, something original. Does that seem strange?﻿

    As long as I'm here....

    "If Lindsey had put up some covers here and there, without them being sponsored"
    --She can't monetize covers, at least not without permission from the copyright holders. She pays most of her touring expenses out of pocket. You have a choice, either non-sponsored covers or live concerts, not both. (And considering how packed her concerts are, don't expect those to go away anytime soon.)

    "kept her behind the scenes stuff on LindseyTime, which she always used to do prior to this year" 
    --Except for before LindseyTime existed.

    "If Lindsey posted about her merchandise once, or a few times, as long as it within a reasonable amount of time between" 
    --She's been pretty dang consistent about the pace of her merch plugs for the past 5-6 years.

    "If Lindsey communicated with her fans, not the same five, and not with some advertisement following up"
    --TONS of her old videos had ads following up at the end. And she communicates with lots of fans; people on the official FB group gush about her talking to them all the time. She just doesn't communicate with *you*.

    "maybe pressed the like button for a few posts on each YouTube video"
    --There is literally NO way to determine whether or not she does this, unless she does it to your specific post (which she wouldn't, because nobody presses Like on comments they don't like), so you'd get the notification.

    "If Lindsey had worked with any corporation, but she hadn't fused their stuff into her videos to the point it became the sole focus"
    --It wasn't the sole focus; your argument is invalid.

    "If Lindsey hadn't made every music video some bizarre, overly-produced, and meaningless thing, reduced the collabs a little bit, so it wasn't half the stinking album, and then gone straight into making the most overused music in the history of music, a Christmas album"
    --This entire paragraph is about your personal preferences, your inability to recognize that what doesn't have meaning to you might still have meaning for others, your asinine vendetta against Christmas. Catering exclusively to John Avery's particular tastes is not the purpose of Lindsey Stirling's career.

    "Does that seem like too much of an expectation?"
    --YES.﻿

    CaptHayfever: If you're going to be dimwitted, do keep you mouth closed... 

     1. It takes no effort on her part to put up a cover, and suggesting monetary issues being the cause for her reduction of them in the past year only supports my claim about her obsession for money... There are other violinists, those making money and touring, still putting up covers regularly. What a shame. You're wrong...

    2. Yet, LindseyTime DOES exist, and has for a very long time, making your point invalid and redundant, and being it holds the predominance of past behind the scenes, only diverting them back to the main this year. There's a strong indication the main isn't getting enough traffic, so she's putting them up on the main for said purpose. 

    3. This one you're completely wrong on, as she has spiked her advertisements on Twitter in the past year, and she posts them back-to-back, within minutes of the first one, serving no purpose but spamming. 

    4. You misunderstood (not my problem), and I know she's not communicating with people, too, minus the head sheep anyway, in which case, they get replied to once in a blue moon, and an advertisement post is put up shortly following, not via a video, although the post has been about her newest video many times.

    5. You really are slow, aren't you? If Lindsey liked anything, it skyrockets to the top, as it used to in the past, prior to her stopping. This would also contradict communityband1's claim she removed them, and she no longer likes or replies to anything. Very nice job, making others on your side look worse... 

    6. In your delusional mind, and this video was what exactly, if not for the focus of selling the Sprocket? Your point is invalid... 

    7. Yes, it's my personal preference, and the countless other people thinking the same thing don't exist... Also, vendetta against Christmas? You're literally assuming something which doesn't exist. I have never implied I have any issue with the holiday, only the overused music countless musicians have rehashed. There something hidden in your own mind, a hint of your own vendetta? It's very likely... 

    The amount of redundant, assuming, unintelligent, and false responses you offer are even more flustering than communityband1's information bombardment, though at least his logic has something of intelligence behind his words. You literally have zero behind yours, and the points you made prove your inadequacy to hold your side of a debate perfectly. If you can't handle yourself, and you can't make any points, and I mean ANY, as I said, do keep your trap closed, and let someone smarter than you speak.﻿

    CaptHayfever Thanks! I'm guessing you're probably pretty sick of reading these comments, but I do appreciate you taking the time to show your support. I thought it was probably you sticking by me in that other long thread, too. I'm grateful.

    John, thank you for trying to shift the tone down. The language filter in place on this channel suggests the vibe Lindsey hopes to set, and even if she isn't choosing to ban us, it's still a nice gesture on our part to fit into that as much as our discussion allows.

    My impulse is to respond to each of your points. But it may be better to address this in broader strokes. First, you're looking for concessions from me. I think you're frustrated that I haven't seemed to give any ground. Please understand that I have been deliberate about choosing my positions. I'm uncomfortable making claims that I don't feel very certain I can defend objectively. For example, I avoid arguing that Lindsey could not have sold more albums if she kept to a familiar style. I don't know the answer to that, and I see many factors involved. You saw earlier in this thread that I agreed it was likely Lindsey's advertisements for HP may have been less controversial if they were more direct. I do not disagree that people feel this way. I just intend to challenge the justification for such feelings and explain how they can work against us. Lindsey is in a privileged position, seeing this from a side that most of us can't. If I put myself in her shoes, I see the good that comes to all of us from this partnership.

    Looking at your points, I see a methodology that I hope I can fairly summarize like this: "I've noticed a variety of consistent behaviors that I suspect may suggest Lindsey does not care for people any longer. To test my suspicions, I will closely watch her behavior in these areas. I know that any of these taken alone could have alternative explanations, but taken as a whole, they should give me a fair basis for conclusion. If she changes any of these, it will be a sign that perhaps she does care." 

    Can you understand why this approach, when applied to a variety of people and situations, will generally lead to positive confirmations? It begins with the exclusive or highly favored selection of data which is already predesignated as positive evidence. The data is even selected in part because of its consistent nature. Statistically, we should expect to see data which is consistent continue to be consistent, and as that data is our proof, we will typically fulfill our hypothesis. "If this thing that's been consistent doesn't change, then it's proof we were right."

    I hope you can understand why that approach leads us into trouble. It makes it far more likely that we'll reach errant conclusions. It enormously emphasizes the weight of data that we feel supports our guesses and almost completely disregards any other evidence we may discover that could change our conclusions. And it begins with assumptions about the meaning of our data, even though we understand those assumptions could be false.

    If you applied this to me, we could have a simple analysis like this: "This guy writes in a formal way, very rarely showing emotion, even when pressed. We suspect this may mean he is a relatively unemotional person. To test this, we'll continue to watch his writing. If it doesn't change, we'll have more evidence that he's an unemotional person." I'm sure you can see where this approach goes wrong. It relies entirely on the initial interpretation of the writing, and we only trick ourselves into thinking that it becomes more meaningful as it continues to be consistent.

    With Lindsey, you're starting from the premise that these clues indicate what you believe. But every clue has very reasonable alternative explanations. If you'd like me to dive into a particular one, please ask. Very generally, I believe Lindsey sees no conflict between caring for people and pointing people to her products. This is an incredibly common part of our society. Millions of business owners take every opportunity to get the word out on their offerings, but it certainly doesn't prevent them from caring about people. These things plainly aren't at odds. Lindsey created her social media accounts to share information about her products, and this purpose is very clear when we sign up. She can certainly assume that most who follow her and keep this connection active are interested in these announcements. There are also people interested in more personal communication, but the comparatively tiny number of comments on each video, tweet or Facebook post is evidence that most of her followers are not this invested.

    I understand that you perceive the need for a sort of a balancing act between doing some things for money and doing things only to show she cares. I very much doubt she sees things this way. I think she's been in business long enough now to be past the hangups that some people have about giving people the option to purchase their products and services. People sometimes feel like inviting others to pay for their work is akin to asking for a favor, but it's not. We give people a choice to trade for something if they feel it has more value to them. That's good. And it's perfectly common for that to coexist with genuine care and appreciation.

    I also believe that Lindsey likes to communicate with fans in person more than online. I think her decision to travel to South America, even though ticket prices are lower there, is likely in part because she wants to demonstrate her appreciation to those fans. In any case, I suspect she probably feels that her direct contact with thousands of fans is more than a balance for any amount of reduced contact online. It's certainly more demanding on her time.

    At this point, I think you've felt in the past that we come to a place where it's impossible to prove either side, and we're left with what we think more likely. My least important answer to that is that what is most common will also be most likely. In this case, the scenario of a human being actually caring for nothing except money or fame is a scenario that none of us have ever witnessed personally with someone we know well. Every time we become close to people, we discover that they have entire worlds of unique thoughts and emotions. The more we learn, the less easy it is for us to summarize them. And we know this is a common experience, because everyone says the same thing about their friends and loved ones. If we guess that this evidence truly means Lindsey cares for nothing but money and attention, we're betting against incredible odds.

    My far more important answer is that we should choose a better method of testing our hypothesis. In this case, instead of seeking evidence to prove it, we should focus our search for evidence that disproves it. One reason is a matter of practicality. To prove that an action can only be explained by an interest in fame or money, we must prove that it can not be attributed to an infinite number of other possible motivations or rationale. That's mathematically daunting. However, to prove the opposite, we only need to prove that an action can not be explained by either an interest in fame or an interest in money. We effectively bring our test cases from infinite down to two.

    So with this in mind, I'll introduce a new bit of data that we haven't discussed yet, and I'll ask how this could either be explained by an interest in fame or money. You brought my attention to this when I was looking for statements Lindsey has made about equality.

    This past January, Lindsey tweeted her agreement with a highly controversial position on women's rights. She stated that she has never felt that society has held her back as a woman from enjoying the same opportunities as men. She said that she feels her success is limited only by her willingness to work hard. The background to this of course was a time when many women were feeling particularly angry about Trump's election and their perception of his views towards women. In her followup replies, Lindsey expressed that she was nervous about sharing this opinion because she knew it was unpopular. And she did indeed take a lot of heat for it from individuals who responded and in some cases rescinded their support. Lindsey's statements could be described as politically conservative. Coming from a religious family, it would not surprise me if she does lean that way (as I do). But the vast majority of her fans are young and generally swing the opposite direction, especially on social matters. The opinion also runs counter to most celebrities, particularly females, and this could damage her standing with people she may hope to work with in the future. In short, she stood to lose favor by voicing this view. 

    I suggest that Lindsey entered into this discussion fully understanding it could hurt her financially and lessen people's opinions of her. But it seemed to still be important enough to her to speak up. I think this demonstrates that Lindsey prioritized her moral convictions above money or fame in this instance.﻿

    Just a quick note, I can't reproduce this. I tried Liking a comment on one of my videos, and it didn't change its position. I suspect that Lindsey avoids showing Likes for the same reason she removed her comments, whatever that may be. It doesn't seem to help her make money, if John's displeasure is anything to go on.﻿

    communityband1: As it's still a very prevalent thought, if you two are one in the same, for the suspicions I'm still noticing on occasion, you're good creating some differences in character and intelligence, but certainly create noticeable things, too. However, such an issue is still insignificant, as the ultimate goal is the same for both, although more tolerable for the one without the lack of anything intelligent to say, and only prattles on like he was speaking intellectually, but his entire argument is bias opinion and contradiction, redundancy sprinkled in the mix. CaptHayfever, keep to yourself, silently, in the comments, watching, but not speaking. I have little patience in the ways of sheep anymore, especially bias, dimwitted ones, and, as your name is so properly fitting, you are about as tolerable and enjoyable as an actual hay fever...  Regardless... 

    Whereas I can understand your mentality, the method by which I could seek proof being faulty, attempting to search for evidence of a thought established upon first glance isn't soundly perfect, it's not the way I go about things. Yes, I have searched for evidence to support my many claims, but I have also searched for evidence to their contrary. The problem is, with every piece of evidence I've found to contradict my claims, there was another justification easily explaining the contradiction as not being contradictory, only another piece of evidence to support my claim. It's difficult to imagine, but I'm not wholly subjective in my opinions, because it would be hypocritical of me, saying sheep fans are bias for Lindsey, as I was being bias against her, which although not sheepish, would still be bias in its own respect. I'll take an example. When I first got a reply from you, my very first inclination was not you being a sheep and unfeeling. However, both of them were still theories to be proven accurate or false. If I was bias and only searched for proof of them, I would be calling you an unfeeling sheep. Yet, though I still support my claim, based on evidence I've noticed you are unfeeling, I have found more evidence to the contrary you're not a sheep, given you are willing to acknowledge Lindsey has made several faults, unlike the rest of her fans, unwilling to say so, thinking she's perfect, even if the initial theory was you could be both of them. You see? It's possible for me to realize my original thoughts could be wrong, but could also be correct. It happened with you, of all people. So, if we're to realize I share the same idea, the same method with Lindsey, which I do, and the evidence to my claims overwhelmingly supports them, while the contradictory evidence exists, but is outweighed or explained away, we're left with the conclusion she is as she is, based on the EVIDENCE saying is, not the way I think she is, because evidence is better than bias. 

    I'll also point out people quickly forgot about her claim in January, because of the unfortunate circumstance overshadowing the claim very shortly then thereafter. Yes, she did get negative criticism, but it stopped with the passing of her father. Plus, although I stay away from politics as much as possible, and I didn't support the manner by which females reacted, the method Lindsey went about it was callous and borderline against her own gender, never mind extremely ignorant of her to say. If she doesn't experience the problems of most women, it doesn't mean it's nonexistent, and she's very shallow to think anything less. You recall, my issues lie within morality, and there's nothing less morally unjust than her ignorant claims, which I was going to mention to you, but you found on your own. Lindsey is very backwards with her views, and there's a good reason people assume she's privileged, because her claims make her come off as such, even if she is, as it were, far from privileged as a child. Yes, there's a heavy degree of ignorance on the part of those claiming her as this and that without any evidence past a post, but she deserved it for her even more ignorant claim. It's the very same claim which made me realize she's no sweetheart, and she's far less loving than people give her credit for, but people will never acknowledge, because of the timing overshadowing the claim, lest she opens her ignorant mouth again...﻿

    If somebody being dimwitted has to keep their mouth closed, why is yours still open?

    1) She still edits her videos, plus there's the issue of time for rehearsal, filming, et cet. To suggest that "it takes no effort on her part to put up a cover" is completely inane.

    2) It disproves your implication that she never did behind-the-scenes stuff on the main in the past. Besides, if the main is getting less traffic, that's probably because the main is getting fewer videos...because a lot of the stuff she used to post on her main got moved to LindseyTime.

    3) I don't use Twitter. I don't care about Twitter. Twitter sucks.

    4) You write that trainwreck of a sentence, & then you blame ME for misunderstanding what you mean?

    5) No, if she replies to something, it skyrockets to the top. YouTube does not show the public who Likes comments; it only shows the original commenter.

    6) You said "sole focus". The Sprocket was barely even onscreen in this nearly-9-minute video & was only mentioned by name once or twice. There was plenty else to focus on. The Phelba "Hold My Heart" video, you might have a case for saying "sole focus," but definitely not this one. Your counterargument is invalid.

    7) I'm not saying others don't share your overly-narrow musical tastes. I'm saying that you don't have the right to DEMAND that Lindsey conform to your overly-narrow musical tastes. And you CONTINUE to blindly & incorrectly assume that all Christmas albums consist exclusively of old songs.

    BONUS) "if you two are one in the same" 
    WE BOTH HAVE VIDEOS ON OUR CHANNELS WHERE WE APPEAR ONSCREEN, YOU NUMBSKULL.

    You continue to draw conclusions based on fallacious logic and/or false premises. Stop smelling your own farts.﻿

    CaptHayfever: Do you think you're special, because you're using can boldface letters... Seriously, knock it off. It's not impressing anyone but you... Also, your last little comment there shows your maturity level being like that of a five-year-old, coincidentally, your intelligence level... 

    1. Yes, it takes so long to put out the cover of "It Aint Me," where she's standing in one or two places, moving her hips back-and-forth... There's also so much effort put into sitting in a chair for her cover of Green Day... Yes, so much effort... 

    2. No, it doesn't... When LindseyTime was created, behind the scenes moved, and she only brought it back to the main channel for traffic this year. The main channel was treated as both in the beginning, but split the focus with the creation of her second channel. This too complicated for you to understand, because I can't put it much clearer...

    3. Thanks for your life story... So, I guess you wouldn't know about her advertisement ratio, would you? Thus, your credibility and point is gone. Your stupidity is both baffling and sad... 

    4. Yes, I am, and I notice you using more of my words and phrases lately to sound smarter... It's both flattering and pathetic... 

    5. Are you serious? Wow, this proves your dim... The uploader's channel icon with the heart next to it is specifically designed to show the public the uploader liked the comment... Do grow a pair of eyes... I would say grow a brain, but I think cold fusion would be invented first...  

    6. Yes because the people suggesting this video is an advertisement means it's not coming off as the sole focus of selling the Sprocket...  

    7. So, if I go out to the store around the holidays, and pick up several of the dozens of them, I'm not going to see the same songs on more than half? Good luck... Plus, if she did anything else but generic pop and used music, like a Christmas album, even if it were polka, I wouldn't mind... 

    Bonus: I couldn't care less enough to view your channel to see if you had been... So, congratulations, I was wrong about the most inane thing (you likely never used "inane" prior to me saying it). The rest of this, I'll highlight you saying likes weren't public, as YouTube created a specific icon for the main channel, being incredibly perfect for showing off your lack of intelligence, you, as always, couldn't hold your own worth a single inch... Perhaps, take my advice this time, and keep quiet, liking the comments of more intelligent people than you... However, if you feel like humiliating yourself a little more, even if it's pointless for me, I'll gladly keep making you realize your asinine claims are wrong. I can see why you support Lindsey. You're fitting her fans' predominance of blind, sheepish behavior perfectly...﻿

    "The problem is, with every piece of evidence I've found to contradict my claims, there was another justification easily explaining the contradiction as not being contradictory, only another piece of evidence to support my claim."

    I don't feel you're being sincere here. First of all, you've stated things in the past that make it clear you do realize Lindsey cares about more than money or fame. Secondly, you have not answered many of the examples I've given. You have not explained why Lindsey would seek help from a therapist to deal with the pain she was struggling with. You have not explained how she could feel pain at all. You haven't explained how she could fall in love. I can not take you seriously if you don't admit that Lindsey feels a huge range of emotions. Your own statements make it clear that you understand this, but you shifted your position when you became angry.

    I want to revisit something I've never addressed. You believe that Lindsey posts social comments that contain no advertising in close proximity to comments that do contain advertising in order to butter people up and convince them to buy. This concept is a little crazy. There is no good reason Lindsey should believe that such a tactic would make a difference. If a person follows Lindsey on Twitter or Facebook, he will have a long history of Lindsey's posts to draw from to understand who she is. Lindsey isn't going to change people's minds in a 48 hour period to suddenly believe she's a nice person and thus compel them to buy. People aren't going to be persuaded to buy viola music just because Lindsey replied to a stranger the day before. It's a silly concept. And it couldn't even work on Facebook. Studies show the average post on Facebook by an account with hundreds of thousands of followers goes out to only about 2% of them. Facebook's algorithms are designed to greatly restrict this to avoid inundating users with posts.

    It should be obvious that if Lindsey was manipulating this and truly believed it made a difference, she'd be far more consistent with it. We're back to this same paradox. You want to believe that Lindsey believes being friendly makes her money, but you also want to claim that she is friendly less often because she only cares about money. It doesn't work.

    "Yet, though I still support my claim, based on evidence I've noticed you are unfeeling..."

    You've never noticed any evidence of this.

    "...willing to acknowledge Lindsey has made several faults..."

    Of course she has faults - she's human. But which are you referring to that I've agreed are faults?

    "So, if we're to realize I share the same idea, the same method with Lindsey, which I do, and the evidence to my claims overwhelmingly supports them, while the contradictory evidence exists, but is outweighed or explained away, we're left with the conclusion she is as she is, based on the EVIDENCE saying is, not the way I think she is, because evidence is better than bias."

    Please don't take offense, but I encourage you to head a different direction with your writing. Your sentences don't flow as well and become less readable when you meander through these little asides. I only bring this up because you seem to be doing more of it, and I hope I can help by pointing it out. Writing guides discourage this. I certainly welcome feedback on my writing as well. I want to improve. I still get lost at times trying to be sophisticated while forgetting that the purpose is to communicate my thoughts.

    Regarding the content, the problem is as I stated before. You're not trusting evidence, you're trusting your interpretation of data. There is nothing overwhelming about your interpretations. They're paradoxical, they bet against our personal experience with people we know, and they're completely unnecessary. Why does Lindsey work with corporations? It helps her, it helps us, and it hurts nobody. Turning it down would be both foolish and selfish. Why does she advertise frequently? To run and grow her business. Why doesn't she spend more time online? She spends countless hours talking to fans and thanking them in person, far more than when she first started. It's wild to think that she could feel she shows less appreciation today than she has in the past. Do you think she sees her fans in separate boxes? Should she expect someone to tally online interaction with fans separately from face-to-face interaction with fans? Why would we add things up this way? It all comes from the same pool of her time. Lindsey's time is now 75% on the road. Her interaction with fans is there. Lindsey is as busy as anyone we know and balances her career with new relationships and other big changes in her life. We don't need conspiracy theories to explain anything. We just need common sense and the will to put ourselves in her shoes.

    You didn't directly answer my question, but your answer suggests you understand that her comments about equality don't fit the money/fame mold. Lindsey stood by her beliefs even though they could hurt her financially and socially. Her beliefs are more important to her than money or fame. Of course this isn't the only evidence available to us. We also know that she has turned down many professional opportunities that conflict with her beliefs.

    Now, on to your assertions about these beliefs. Do you feel that anger or resentment has never made you less than hospitable? Lindsey shared her feelings about a march that was full of people spewing anger. People weren't merely expressing rational concerns. Whatever truths existed in their complaints were buried under torrents of abusive language and blame. I believe Lindsey's father instilled in her the wisdom that blame is insulting not only to those we lay it on, but also to ourselves. It gives away our ability to control our destiny. Lindsey has shown consistently that she wants to empower people and help them know they can achieve anything. These people stood for something that runs counter to that. They also equated abortion with human rights. Lindsey's opposition to these messages is more than understandable.

    If Lindsey was politely challenged by someone bringing up statistics on wages, she may have felt willing to discuss the causes behind that (and it's a complicated topic). But that isn't the direction the discussion turned. She was insulted and put on defense. We all understand how challenging it is to be accommodating in that situation. I see defensiveness in Lindsey's response, not apathy.

    And finally, I'm going to explain what I feel was missing from that discussion. Lindsey understands the true battle for women's equality far better than those who confronted her. The problem we face is not that women are treated unfairly. There are some examples of that, to be sure. The greatest problem, however, is that our culture has a way of shaping the career paths women seek. Lindsey has talked about girls traditionally being less proficient with technology. Many companies struggle to find women interested in science and technology careers. We need to do a better job helping students in our schools - male and female - explore and discover their interests. We need to examine where these interests disappear and ask if there are cultural or educational factors involved. The greatest challenge we face is not to change the rules to make things fair. We need to change how people see the world and the opportunities before them.

    I see Lindsey as a champion of the women's movement because she inspires young women to dream, and then she inspires them to make those dreams come true.

    Haha, I had the worst time figuring out what word caused my edited post to be deleted. I had written "sheetmusic," but spelled correctly as two words. The filter apparently assumes that the first half of that word, stated separately, is an attempt to get around something else. :-) I wonder how many posts asking for violin or viola parts have never been seen because of this.﻿

    communityband: As a beginning note, my apologies for implying you were CaptHayfever. I should've looked slightly more into the notion, even though I have little desire to view any commentor's channel. The concept simply arose from certain words both of you used, phrases, and rapidity of liking one another's comments. Of course, I had figured you weren't able to reduce your own intelligence so low... Plus, though flustering, you've provided something of intelligence in your arguments, and you've looked into certain things, like knowing if a specific icon was created for showing people the channel owner liked your comment, which mostly everyone using YouTube knows, prior to boldly claiming otherwise... I'm likely never forgetting the stupidity of such a thing... Regardless. 

    I have tried, multiple times, to address many of your claims, but this lovely setting Lindsey has on her account, makes it incredibly difficult to reply to such things, as the subjects you listed need several words, which often trigger the automatic muting, to the point I try six or seven times, get flustered, and cut the section out entirely, to reply to more prevalent topics. There is very little way around this system, as you have experienced firsthand. If it's of such great consequence to you, do let me know, and I'll attempt to reply to them. Otherwise, it's not worth my time. 

    This strategy is as simple as anything, and I have personally taken classes on the psychology of the strategy, and it is far less "crazy" than you accuse it of being. In boiled down terms, if one is given positive feelings, and nothing creates positive feelings for Lindsey's fans more than her saying she "loves them" or something along those lines, they'll be more opted to respond in an agreeing, compliant manner to the next thing she posts, e.g. viewing her newest video. Lindsey knows this, or, at the very least, is convinced it works without knowing the psychology. I'm half-surprised you aren't aware of this, given your interest in such things. As to the "paradox." There is no paradox. She is less friendly, and the only time she is friendly is if she needs to get her fans to feel cared for, with the intent of monetary value. Where's the paradox? 

    This one is simple. You've mentioned many of Lindsey's business-related faults (non-human faults). Also, I have already presented evidence to support my claims you're unfeeling, which you glanced over, gave some type of rationale for, or felt it wasn't important enough to address, my claims of you regurgitating information, to a question more easily replied to with emotional human thought and logic, being one such example.

    It's more or less of habitual method of writing on my part, along with occasional running on, and it's not offensive if you point it out, although not something I can see putting a high priority towards changing. 

    According to one of her fans, in a comment I read recently, she spoke to Lindsey for 15 seconds prior to being ushered out the door... How is that communication exactly? What can you feasibly say in 15 seconds, given most his spent on introduction between both parties? Plus, and I emphasize this, you're paying for it... So, given she's getting money, it seems more in support of my claim she's doing it for money than anything else. 

    Everyone makes these claims, she's turned down opportunities, but never provide anything specific. Do you have any examples of something she turned down for her beliefs. 

    As you've mentioned in the past, Lindsey is very heavily rooted spirituality (religion), which, if you haven't noticed, isn't in support of certain things one of morality understands. It's a dangerous thing, putting your ideas in such things, because it's predisposed teaching versus something many people are innately born with, as if biologically understood. If Lindsey bases her logic on religious teachings more than instinctual moral realization, she has the potentiality to think poorly. If someone has "relations" in lack of the actual word starting with "s," (thank you muting system...) prior to marriage, in her religion, a big no-no, versus the person who didn't, but the person who doesn't favor her beliefs could think more rationally than the person who did, she'll likely pick the one who favors her religion, because it plays so much of a part in her thoughts. Conversely, a morally conscious person would observe the person more suited to the task, unhindered by something religion feels is important, but morality deems inconsequential. If you don't know the thing I'm referring to, watch the news for five minutes... You'll understand... Lindsey never openly said her choice, but there's plenty to imply we know who she picked, because the latter had a husband not favoring the religion she follows... This would also explain the reason she felt the way she did with the march, a hint of anger towards people who weren't on the side she picked. There's nothing Lindsey has done to create the open-minded thinking more women have to speak up for equality. If anything, she's presented thoughts which would hinder them. Lindsey has even admitted she wouldn't have existed, career wise, had it not been for Devin Graham. Therefore, she's no champion. She didn't do this on her own, and she isn't as strong as people make her out... There's nothing wrong with being helped, but don't come off as this person who did everything herself, because it's not the truth... Lindsey did this, Lindsey did that... Yes, WITH other's help, not on her own.﻿

    I am now being insulted for knowing how to format text. That alone should serve as sufficient rebuttal to anything Johnny-boy just said to me.

    1) The Green Day cover was filmed by the Recording Academy to promote the most recent Grammys ceremony. "It Ain't Me" was (a) a collab, so the schedule of the other artist had to be accommodated, (b) a location shoot, so travel had to be accommodated, & (c) done from several different angles, so it probably took several hours to film. Also, again, editing. Music video editing takes quite a while, because the audio has to sync up.

    2) You just said the exact same thing I did, but in a less clear way.

    3) Meanwhile, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, et cet, she's NOT doing that. Only on Twitter, which sucks anyway.

    4) Read: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho

    5) The heart icon is (a) brand-spanking new, & (b) a completely different button from the usual thumbs-up. Grow a pair of eyes yourself.

    6) There's some focus on the Sprocket, but it clearly is not the sole focus, since the majority of the screen time is spent on the story of Erich's family & Lindsey's gift for him. Learn what "sole" means before you respond.

    7) I never said anything about "more than half". You set that quota just now.

    B) You couldn't care less to take 30 seconds to see if the accusation you made 5 times was correct? That's beyond unintelligent; that's outright malicious, bordering on slanderous.

    You wouldn't be so disturbingly insistent that I stay quiet if I wasn't striking a chord.
    (Prediction: Your next response to me consists primarily of childish insults of my intelligence & arrogant assumptions that I never used common words before seeing you use them & a lot of long-winded gibberish.)﻿

    CaptHayfever: No, you're being called out for trying to make yourself feel special... Do you possess the ability to underline, too? Do you want to put some emojis towards the end of your comments? 

    1. Basically, you're trying to make the entire process feel more involved than it actually is... If I wrote the same way for making toast, it would sound like it was complicated... Relatively, it takes no time or effort. 

    2. No, you're arguing she has a reason for moving the behind the scenes back to the main, and I'm countering it with she doesn't... Confused, I see... not surprising... 

    3. Again... thanks for your life story on your dislike of Twitter... You also changed the subject. It still increased on Twitter, whether or not you use it... So, you're wrong. 

    4. Yes, I'm definitely clicking on some link you provide... 

    5. You changed the subject... again... This how you solve being wrong? It still exists, new or not, different button or not, and you're point was people couldn't see Lindsey liking something, which they can... Do try keeping on the same topic... 

    6. "Ah, look, I wrote this in bold. It makes me seem like I'm making my point better, but I'm actually using a cheap trick to make me look special." You really are five... It doesn't matter how it's presented, the sole focus was to sell the Sprocket, using a story... 

    7. "And you CONTINUE to blindly & incorrectly assume that all Christmas albums consist exclusively of old songs." If I say half of them have the same songs, which are old, establishing a quota or not, the point is the same, it's overused... 

    I hardly have to insult you... You do perfectly fine on your own. However, I'm still going to point out if you're being a dimwit. Nice try with the reverse psychology bit to get me to stop. You aren't striking a chord, but notice how you're the one denigrating in this conversation? Do you know what that word means? No, probably not... When you're done google searching, you come back to me, because we both know you're coming back to say more, and, if you don't, I couldn't care less. So, I'll either be proven correct, or I won't have you to reply to, win-win for me, corporalallegicrhinitis...﻿

    "As a beginning note, my apologies for implying you were CaptHayfever."

    The insult is the other way around. I feel badly for CaptHayfever for being confused with me. I want to take a second to weigh in on a couple of small points in your discussion with him. As he has noted, the Like button is separate from these new buttons that create the icons you mention. I imagine you haven't seen this if you don't have an account where you've posted videos. Secondly, I know from experience that the work that goes into the audio side of videos like "It Ain't Me" is substantial. I couldn't produce a track that well myself. It's not just a matter of recording those tracks and slapping on some effects. There is a lot of cleanup to do to line notes up in the mix properly, balance each part, intermix tracks, correct tuning (tuning plugins tend to butcher instruments with rich harmonics), and so on. Lindsey doesn't do all of this herself of course, but she is involved with the process. It's not trivial by any stretch. On the video side, if editing like this doesn't take her long, then it's a testament to how good she is. I've spent days working on things that aren't nearly as sophisticated. Granted, I'm terrible, but I highly recommend getting your feet wet with some of this if you want to appreciate what she's doing. I honestly can not understand how she manages to do all of this with everything else that she has going on.

    Regarding your choice of the word "sole..." I agree that the initiation of the thought that went into this video happened solely because Lindsey partnered with HP. The requirements of this partnership inspired Lindsey to think up a way to complete her obligations in a way that also did something nice for Erich and his family. But I don't agree that the sole purpose of the video was to advertise the Sprocket, and I say this because it's clear to me that the team also wanted to have fun and surprise Erich. The situation is akin to those that many of us encounter when we do something nice for people while also doing our jobs. Acts of kindness don't lack meaning or genuineness just because we benefit. Forget about money for a second. Every kind thing we do for others also benefits ourselves. We gain the knowledge that we've helped someone, and we avoid the shame that would come if we didn't help. In this sense, it's very hard to argue that altruism is ever real. Everything we do is self-serving in some way. But we obviously know that even though we serve ourselves, we still genuinely care about people. Genuine acts of kindness and personal gain coexist throughout our lives, and there's nothing magical about money that blocks this. So no, we shouldn't believe that the sole purpose of this video was personal gain for Lindsey. She also wanted to do something nice for people she cares about. To me, this is actually what makes this commercial cool. Lindsey got creative and used a product she is obligated to advertise in a way that shows how it can be used to do nice things for people we care about. Someone can actually take this commercial as an inspiration to do something nice for a friend. Come on. I know it's unconventional. I know that it surprises people when they realize it's an ad. But when we understand from an economics perspective how we all benefit from this and that there aren't actually any victims, we should see why this is actually pretty neat. She advertised the Sprocket by using it in life. That's innovative.

    "Otherwise, it's not worth my time."

    I think it's very much worth your time, and not because you owe me an answer. :-) You've agreed in the past that you stand to gain much more by proving yourself wrong. So yes, I do ask that you make additional efforts to answer my questions so that I may challenge your explanations. I understand the struggle of figuring out which words cause problems. I may take a few minutes to write a little application that helps me isolate illegal words. The approach I'm thinking of is simply to copy and paste text from successful comments (mine or other people's) to create a dictionary of known legal words. Then when I have a comment that won't post, I'll use it to see which words aren't already in the legal list. It should greatly reduce the number of words to check, and it will improve with time. If it works for me, I'll share it with you, if you like.

    "I'm half-surprised you aren't aware of this, given your interest in such things."

    Yes, I apologize, I must not have been clear enough. The examples we're looking at on Twitter don't include a lot of the "I love you guys!" praise. During the course of this year, she's only tweeted that type of thing a handful of times (I just examined all of her tweets that include the word "love"). The vast majority of her advertisement tweets are not preceded by praise for the people those advertisements target. I've worked under the assumption that you instead point to the broader collection of all of her tweets that don't contain advertising, such as comments about loving her country, support for flood victims, thanking people for attending her performances, pointing to other people's art, and so on. These things improve our general impression of Lindsey's character, but they don't typically praise or influence a group of people likely to purchase whatever it is that she advertises next.

    Now broadly speaking, Lindsey certainly gains by being nice to people. And I'm sure she is nice to people in part because she hopes they will be nice to her in return. But this is required of all of us. When we go for a job interview, we behave extremely politely because we want to create a good impression with the people who decide whether or not to give us thousands of dollars. When we talk to our friends, we are friendly because we value our friendships and want them to continue. We are especially friendly with potential significant others. Being nice to people partly because we hope for a return is expected of all of us. But even so, it never prevents us from genuinely caring for people. We should not judge someone on these grounds, because we all do it. And what's more, we all should do it. Society is better off when we do things that help others and also help ourselves. When we do things that are nice for people and also help us grow, our ability to do nice things expands. People are alive today who say that Lindsey gave them the hope they needed to continue living. Her kindness brought her success that in turn magnified her potential to show kindness, and many more benefited as a result. Society is largely built on this.

    "You've mentioned many of Lindsey's business-related faults (non-human faults)."

    Okay, just to make sure we're on the same page, I showed examples where Lindsey has made a number of intentional decisions to forego money in favor of personal standards and the opportunities to do things she enjoys. I don't think of these as faults, but yes, they do bring her less money.

    "Also, I have already presented evidence to support my claims you're unfeeling..."

    I'm trying to help you see something here. You've presented data and shared your interpretation of it. But that data has never actually supported your interpretation. Now please dive a little deeper and see if you can offer an alternative explanation.

    "Plus, and I emphasize this, you're paying for it..."

    And how does this change things for Lindsey? If she spends a short amount of time communicating with hundreds of fans individually, how much does that add up to? How much energy does she expend? Let's put ourselves in her shoes. From her perspective, the emotional effort and drain from communicating with thousands of fans is not mitigated by money - if anything, it's increased. She does not feel less thankful or show less thanks to people who come to her shows. You aren't really asking Lindsey to do the same thing she's always done. You're asking her to maintain previous activities while adding bucket loads of interaction with fans, business partners, and people in her life. It doesn't matter that money is involved. Lindsey still has to live it. This would exhaust me. We must also remember that Lindsey is out on the road meeting new people outside of these concerts. That's where she is 75% of her life. We know she communicates with fans who recognize her, and we see occasional examples of this in people's social media posts. Whereas we can see this in terms of paid and unpaid time, for Lindsey, it's all her time. She's the same person all the time. She doesn't have separate stores of time, emotion and energy.

    "Do you have any examples of something she turned down for her beliefs."

    She's spoken to this in general terms in interviews. "I've had to say no to several collaboration opportunities with big-name artists because their songs or their videos were too vulgar and they represented standards that I couldn’t morally support. It was especially difficult in the beginning when I was not well known, because I had offers come up that were very tempting and could have brought me a lot of attention—something I desperately wanted at the time. I'm so glad I didn't cave in to those temptations, because in the end, it all worked out and I'm better off having not done those things. I have also turned down many gigs that were on Sunday."

    "It's a dangerous thing, putting your ideas in such things, because it's predisposed teaching versus something many people are innately born with, as if biologically understood."

    You're presupposing something fairly big - that the teachings of her religion are false. If God exists, all bets are off. And to date, we still don't really have a great explanation for existence. I feel uncomfortable judging people for their beliefs because I don't have answers.

    What I do know is that the strongest and most helpful nations the world has ever known grew under the influence of religion. Throughout history people have abused religions like Christianity to achieve personal gain, but the teachings themselves have also served to advance our society. Religion has compelled people to many more acts of kindness than acts of malice. I do not claim people need religion to behave morally, but many people attribute their most humane actions to their religious beliefs. You say it's dangerous to rely on religion. I say it is at least as risky for society to abandon the influence of religions which teach eternal accountability. We grew strong under such influence, and history has yet to judge the effect of its absence.﻿

    >assumes the only reason anyone uses text formatting is to feel special
    >wonders why people are saying he jumps to ridiculous conclusions

    1) Toast takes a certain amount of time, regardless of how easy it is. Editing & travel take a certain amount of time, regardless of how low-effort they are.

    2) Even if you're right, even if she's only doing it for money, that's still A reason, so saying "she doesn't [have a reason]" makes zero sense.

    3) I didn't change the subject. I pointed out that many of the people who interact with her aren't seeing the increase, so it isn't affecting them.

    4) Read the url; it's the TV Tropes wiki. Dear lord, if you can't be expected to do 2 seconds worth of research before slinging your bile, why the crud should anyone bother listening to a word you say?

    5) If she uses the normal Like button, they can't see it. And since the heart button is new, most of the old videos wouldn't have anything heart-ed *anyway*.

    6) I'm sorry that boldface font killed your parents; that completely justifies your overreaction to it in a way that absolutely no other excuse on earth possibly could. Learn what words mean.

    7) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts

    Even if I had to google "denigrating" (which I didn't, but we're both denigrating each other, for the record), that would just mean that I'm actually capable of verifying something before mouthing off an ignorant response to it.﻿

    CaptHayfever, regarding number 3, you actually just stated the reason that experts recommend duplicating tweets. Most people don't see a majority of the tweets coming from the people they follow. 

    "How many of your Twitter followers read every tweet you send? The number is probably smaller than you think. Reading all of a brand’s tweets requires users to either A) Log in and read tweets extremely frequently… or perpetually, or B) Constantly visit the Twitter profiles of the brands they want to hear from. And as much as it would be great if your tweets were so engaging that they pulled all of your followers over to your profile, the hard truth is, they aren’t. And they don’t."

    "No matter how witty, interesting, or how much value your tweets contain, most of your audience will likely “luck” onto them – they will only see them if they happen to be online right around the time you tweet."

    "So if you’ve got a compelling message, how do you ensure more of your audience sees it? You duplicate your tweets."

    "Now, when we say “duplicate tweets,” that doesn’t mean copy and pasting tweets word-for-word and spamming your followers’ timelines. Instead, we’re using the term loosely, to mean tweeting the same meaning using different words, phrases, calls-to-action and multimedia."

    I'm looking through Lindsey's ad tweets, and they seem to follow this advice. Most aren't duplicated, but those which are typically change up the message or the media. I wonder if she read this. It was published January of 2016. John, I hope you don't mind the formatting. I feel like it makes it easier for the reader to distinguish the quotes I pulled from the external source. That's how I view the purpose of formatting - to make a better experience for the reader.﻿

    CaptHayfever: There's no assumption. You're using boldfaced text, making your "points" stand out more, i.e. making them different. Thus, being your the only one using them, you're trying to stand out from others with this text, which means you're trying to make yourself stand out from everyone else, which means you're trying to be different, and different from everyone else is special. So, you're trying to be special. It's sad I have to put this kind of time into proving something so inane to you, as if this has anything related to my focus, but, if it's going to put you in your place, I suppose it's worth it, though barely...  

    1. Yes, but it's still easy, regardless. Therefore, as I said, easy equals next to no effort required. I'm friends with someone who produces her own music, a wide variety, although she prefers making house music, but she's not famous. So, I get to see the effort required into editing, syncing, filming, etc. It's not difficult if you know what you're doing, and, if you're familiar with the software, which Lindsey is, it's not overwhelming or even close to hard. 

    2. My argument is saying she doesn't have a reason for moving it to the main, unless money and traffic were the prime motivations. So, yes, she has a (I'm not bold-facing this part, like you) reason, but she doesn't have a reason for moving it to the main that's not for greedy purposes. 

    3. You absolutely did. You're initial point was, and I quote, " -She's been pretty dang consistent about the pace of her merch plugs for the past 5-6 years." So, not only did I prove you wrong, proving you changed the topic, I proved you wrong with her increase in Twitter ads, because A. you don't even use it, so you wouldn't have any clue anyway, and B. if I notice, I guess someone noticed...

    4. You're the only one who can answer you're own question, I guess... I couldn't care less if you paid attention to me, because I prefer speaking to someone with more to offer than a tree stump would, in logic and mind, but you are anyway... 

    5. She has used the heart icon in the past, but she stopped. She has commented in the past, but stopped. This is fact. The heart icon equals her liking or "loving," as the icon mentions, something, which means she doesn't like anything... unless we're being so bold as to imply she secretly likes comments with the regular, anonymous like button, in which case, it's pointless then, because she'd be one of several, and the point would be for her to stand out, to show she, herself, not some random reader, liked the comment, which she has the ability to do, but doesn't. 

    6. You didn't even make a point, only relieved your frustration on this one, likely because you don't even have a point anymore... You feeling better about yourself, though? Do you want a cookie...? 

    7. First off, do you have some link obsession? Second. No. If anything, you're the one changing topics to suite your side, skipping from one "point" to another, because you get proven wrong. If you're going to attempt to accuse me of something, perhaps, try not being the one doing the exact thing you're accusing me of... You switched the goal posts so many times, all the grass on the field is gone, and there's only mud left... I proved this on point 3... It's in black and white... Nice try, though... 

    Of course, you definitely knew the meaning of that word... Why is it hard to fathom that? Also, you're the one making five year old comments, whereas I'm simply pointing out your lack of intelligence, technically, we're both denigrating, but you're easily worse... If you're going to keep this up, which there's not much else for you, in the ways of any rebuttals, put in some effort past changing topics, accusing, being generally wrong, and going around in circles. I still have to reply to the novel communityband1 put, and, though it's far more worth my time, in relevance and the fact I'm not arguing with a wall, it's still something I need to put time into both reading and analyzing, not to mention putting effort into a logical response, time wasted on your nonsense...﻿

    communityband1: I haven't the slightest as to the reason you feel the apology goes the opposite way, being you're not the mosquito buzzing around, taking up time for little else than to be a pest, but it's your opinion, and it's not worth arguing, given it's irrelevance. I get enough irrelevance lately, like having to literally outline the reason boldfaced text is someone making themselves special...  Regardless... 

    I've already established, though loosely and not written down, a set of triggers, which varies from account to account. I've noticed profanity is used on certain accounts, not as though I use it, but this one is "touchy," and will mute even the most respectful terms, many not containing any words deemed distasteful, but, for some reason, are not taken kindly towards. Unfortunately, a few triggers on this account are mentioning things in conjunction with word "relationship." It's not easy to justify Lindsey's different ones without having to take so much out, the point is significantly weakened, and I don't want my points to come off as faulty due to this reason. 

    I think you're misunderstanding the way this goes, possibly, or taking it much too literally. The tweets don't have to include the very word "love" to butter up fans, or utilize anything along those lines. It can simply be as easy as thanking fans for something, and then posting the advertisement within minutes to hours past the post thanking them. It's a matter of creating the feeling of care for them, showing gratitude, building up a positive feeling, etc, with the ultimate intent of monetary gain, not likened to the interview scenario you gave, because, in such a scenario, it's already known, on both sides, both are gaining something from the other, and the politeness is just an expected courtesy. Lindsey's fans are not aware she's trying to gain from them, only believe the tweets are showing gratitude. However, by creating this sense of gratitude, unbeknownst to her fans, by posting something in the immediate future, an ad for her video, merchandise, etc, she's using their positive feelings to coax them to buy, view, etc. As I tend to do, I'll make a comparison. If I simply give some person a compliment, I'm not expecting them to give me anything in return. It could happen, but it's not my intention. Yet, If I compliment this person, and then I hand them a card for say a sandwich shop, I'm clearly complimenting them for the focus of getting them to go there. It's genuine versus fake. Lindsey sides on the person complimenting and handing out the card, versus the one simply giving the compliment. It's using her fans for personal gain, not being grateful to her fans. 

    Okay, not attempting to inflate an ego, and this isn't a compliment fest, either. You're not fitting the sheep mentality in the slightest. Yes, you've used sheep logic in the past, but I get the impression you would be willing to say she's capable of something her sheepish fans wouldn't, if given proper evidence. You're also willing to attempt to find such faults, unlike sheepish fans, unwilling to think her capable of anything but perfection. Plus, I'd be hard pressed to find any sheep willing to critique her violin abilities. 

    It's in your manner of writing. It's easily established, my emotions, in my writing, disgust, being upset, etc. If we're analyzing your writing, it's flat line. The only time you've seemed even mildly feeling was, and it's awful to say it's the only time, you saying something I said was bull with an obvious anger in your words. Otherwise, matter-of-fact, vapid, and cold. 

    Expecting Lindsey to maintain a connection with millions of fans is presumptuous and borderline nonsense, which is the reason I don't. However, if the only time you're willing to say something to someone is if 200 dollars is involved, or you need your ego stroked, or to sell/have your fans view something, there's something selfish in the mix. I didn't realize writing a response to a fan, for no reason other than to do it, even it's one sentence, was so taxing... 

    Yes, and most those "standards" no longer exist... There's not too much in the ways of her "standards" she hasn't gone off and broke as of recently, and the very few remaining will likely be broken in the near future... Lindsey could've had them, but I gather she got sick of them, and money was more important... Fame does have some odd results on people... 

    This is getting into area I'm not thrilled speaking about, either. Plus, I think you're misinterpreting my words. I'm not saying anything is true or false, merely implying certain things can be viewed with a pragmatic view, but they seldom are, depending on your strength of belief, and instead it's blindly accepted. If history is any gauge, this belief is the most dangerous one. I'll offer you a philosophic question. If I teach you to believe in something from a young age, aren't you going to believe it, if drilled in your mind, and won't it take a good deal for you to be dissuaded? Conversely, if I teach you the opposite of the same subject, with the same level of intensity, will the result not be exactly the same? So, the question becomes, which is correct? The answer, what's taught to be correct. Lindsey has been taught to think a certain way, believe in certain things, some trivial, like not being able to have caffeine. Do you drink coffee, anything with caffeine in it? Imagine, if that was the factor in her speaking to you. It's unlikely something so pointless would be the case, but, what about the less trivial things? Do they impact her choice, even if you or I wouldn't think they should? As I said, it's a dangerous thing, relying so heavily on something without the ability to question it logically. Morality is, to me, established not by these things, but established by internal instinct. Yes, it can be shifted with spirituality, but it's up to the level and degree of the person listening to establish how much. How much did you say Lindsey relies on her teachings? Does morality really exist to her, or was she taught it? If Lindsey has only this sense of morality, the parts I've mentioned untaught, would she notice they're wrong? If she only has this sense of morality, would she be able to pick something counter to her beliefs, or would she question nothing, and pick based solely on what she was taught? An interesting thought, no?﻿

    I read the bold text the same way as your all-caps words. Both help me understand where emphasis is intended. I see it as a stylistic choice.

    "...and I don't want my points to come off as faulty due to this reason. "

    The filter is annoying, but once I know which word is causing an issue, I've never been unable to find different wording. If you have trouble with a word, then I'll understand if you intentionally misspell it to fool the filter. I listed a variety of things Lindsey does. I'm sure you can answer some of them.

    "The tweets don't have to include the very word "love" to butter up fans, or utilize anything along those lines."

    I understood you, but the data doesn't support this. This morning I went back and read every tweet Lindsey has posted this year. There are only a handful of occasions where she thanks or speaks kindly to her fan base as a whole, and even on these occasions, she doesn't consistently advertise to them soon after (within a day or two). She typically thanks people who came to her shows the night before. She thanks people who share their art with her. She says nice things about individuals. But she's not praising substantial portions of her followers on any sort of consistent basis or with consistent followup advertisements. It has occurred a few times, but it's uncommon. Lindsey isn't doing this tactically, and I think she would consider the idea poor. She knows that most of her followers wouldn't even see both tweets.

    "If I simply give some person a compliment, I'm not expecting them to give me anything in return."

    But you do get something in return - you feel good because you gave the compliment. You satisfy your desire to be kind. None of us are ever altruistic, because personal gain is a part of everything we do. Don't pretend to yourself that money is in a separate class - you've shown it has less value to you than emotional satisfaction. If it didn't, you could spend the time you waste here working or studying to increase your earning potential. If emotional satisfaction wasn't worth a great deal to you, you could turn around and be kind to CaptHayfever even when you're angry with him. You could simply let all of this stuff with Lindsey go. You keep talking about how dangerous money is, and yet there's something more powerful in your life than money that's driving you to try to hurt Lindsey and others. And yes, I too am putting time into this that I should be using for other things.

    "Yet, If I compliment this person, and then I hand them a card for say a sandwich shop, I'm clearly complimenting them for the focus of getting them to go there."

    That's not a limitation of mine, and I don't believe for one second it's a limitation of yours, either. You're human, and I know that you are capable of being genuinely kind to others while also doing things that benefit yourself. We all do this regularly. That's as pure as it gets.

    "Lindsey's fans are not aware she's trying to gain from them..."

    You state this as if you believe Lindsey is the only person who gains when someone pays her for something. That's not what's going on. Money is just a stored up representation of our work - our service. We trade our work for the work that other people do. Both parties gain, because both agree that the value of their own work is worth less to them than the value of the work they acquire. Lindsey has worked for years to create things that people are willing to trade for. It's a good deal. It's an especially good deal when the wonders of digital media make it possible for us to purchase hundreds of hours of labor for 10 dollars. Nobody who pays Lindsey for a product or service is getting cheated in terms of dollars to labor ratio.

    "Yes, you've used sheep logic in the past..."

    Please stop calling people sheep.

    "It's in your manner of writing."

    I asked if you could offer alternative explanations. You are very far off the mark, and I can prove it if I choose to. But I'd like you to think through this and see what clues you can discover that will change your view. I'm hoping you will take the lesson and apply it to other people - not just Lindsey.

    "However, if the only time you're willing to say something to someone is if 200 dollars is involved, or you need your ego stroked, or to sell/have your fans view something, there's something selfish in the mix."

    You dismissed what I wrote. I explained that Lindsey does in fact talk to fans outside of her concerts. I explained that being on the road 75% of her life, she interacts with far more fans in unpaid settings than she did living at home, working on videos. You also exaggerate greatly when you say she doesn't communicate with fans online - she does. She has written very thoughtful replies to people. She has taken the time to read long posts. She takes the time to look at people's artwork and listen to their song covers and then share them. Furthermore, it is completely unfair to discount her numerous initial posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. These are created for her fans, and they take her time.

    And I will not accept this idea that time she spends with fans at her concerts doesn't count. Of course it counts. It doesn't cost her less emotion or energy. She is still giving her life to this.

    "Yes, and most those "standards" no longer exist..."

    Yes they do. I have yet to see Lindsey collaborate in a vulgar video. She still tries to avoid commitments on Sundays.

    "If I teach you to believe in something from a young age, aren't you going to believe it, if drilled in your mind, and won't it take a good deal for you to be dissuaded?"

    We do resist change, but societal change still happens rapidly. We should be cautious, because change may happen most easily where it serves self-interest, but not necessarily society's interests. Religion in America helped preserve families, and studies show that children growing up in single-parent homes struggle more later in life. Our economy is weaker as a result, and crime is higher. The decline of religion in America is doubtlessly quickened by the appeal of living life with less inhibition.

    "So, the question becomes, which is correct? The answer, what's taught to be correct."

    My answer is "unknown" due to a lack of information. We can't prove whether God exists, and He may have an opinion on this. But even passing that up, we still have objective ways of choosing based on what serves society best.

    "Morality is, to me, established not by these things, but established by internal instinct."

    Culture teaches you and I a great deal about morality. It teaches us all far more than religion because we're constantly surrounded and restricted by it.

    "...unhindered by something religion feels is important, but morality deems inconsequential."

    No way, this isn't gonna fly. :-) There are two options here. Either the religion's teachings are divinely inspired, in which case its morals are absolute truths, or they are invented by people and are the result of the same types of factors that inspire this morality which you term instinctual and I note is heavily influenced by culture.

    "There's nothing Lindsey has done to create the open-minded thinking more women have to speak up for equality. If anything, she's presented thoughts which would hinder them. Lindsey has even admitted she wouldn't have existed, career wise, had it not been for Devin Graham. Therefore, she's no champion."

    You should look around at successful entrepreneurs. Lindsey isn't a success because someone helped her. Her success began long before Devin Graham and would have happened without him, even if differently. Lindsey displays the same factors that we've seen in countless success stories - drive, determination, and the will to fail over and over again. People like this don't give up until they win. These are the behaviors that Lindsey inspires in people, and there is nothing more valuable for creating success, regardless of gender. Millions of people complain about injustices they see. But that doesn't change their lives. Those people at the Women's March want to change other people. Lindsey chose to change herself. That's what makes her a champion.﻿

    "You're using boldfaced text, making your "points" stand out more, i.e. making them different. Thus, being your the only one using them, you're trying to stand out from others with this text, which means you're trying to make yourself stand out from everyone else, which means you're trying to be different, and different from everyone else is special. So, you're trying to be special."
    http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic

    "I've already established [...] a set of triggers,"
    ...One of which, apparently, is bold text.

    1) Now who's changing the topic? You originally said, "Yes, it takes so long to put out the cover of "It Aint Me," where she's standing in one or two places, moving her hips back-and-forth" 
    Effort was never the point. Time was. No matter how easy something is, it can still take a lot of time.

    2) And there go those goalposts again. First you say "no reason" then you add the caveat "no reason....except for this one!" Tsk, tsk. Sad.

    3) That's true; I don't know what's going on on Twitter. But I do know what's going on on YouTube, where Lindsey's primary content venue is, thus making it far more relevant to this discussion than Twitter. (Whoopsie, I used one of those evil bold words again to depict the emphasis I would be using if this was a spoken conversation! Shame on me! Ten points from Gryffindor!)

    4) http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck

    5) "Top comments" is the default view for the comment section. Comments with a lot of likes move to the top of "Top comments". Ergo, her liking a comment anonymously still helps it, while avoiding the downright disturbing fawning & worship that some of her fans do when they see her responses or hearts. (Oops, I did it again! I played with your font! Got lost in the game!)

    6) "I proved this on point 3..." ...No, you didn't.

    "you're the one making five year old comments" 
    ...said the guy essentially paraphrasing "I know you are but what am I?"

    "I need to put time into both reading and analyzing, not to mention putting effort into a logical response"
    ...Why start now?

    "I'm not saying anything is true or false"
    ...Yes, you were.

    "Lindsey has even admitted she wouldn't have existed, career wise, had it not been for Devin Graham. Therefore, she's no champion." 
    ...If that's all it took for somebody to be unworthy of your respect, then no one is worthy of your respect. And I'm pretty sure that's what you think, too. (Oh dear, there's strike 3! Looks like I'm out for now. You're up!)﻿

    CaptHayfever: I'd love to reduce myself down to your level, warping Britney Spear's lyrics (out of anyone you could've picked, you picked her...) to sound "clever," or make some reference to a series of literature, which I imagine you didn't read, only watched the films, and I'd love to begin spamming you with boldfaced font, as well as even more links than you posted, but I feel like arguing like a child would, like you have, is simply not accomplishing anything, only serving to move further away from the relevant topics. You can continue to, if you like, but realize, this is only proving my point, you're easily worse than me.  

    The boldfaced text thing... I see we're not letting this irrelevant topic go, and we've attempted to counter logic by saying it's not logic... The fact is you're going to keep using it, increasing with every time I say something, in some attempt to frustrate me. My logic was given, and, as I've said in the past, it's not worth my time arguing this further, even if I could, because it's pointless if you're still doing it anyway. As I said above, though, you enjoy yourself. 

    You completely warped my mentioning of triggers, as I used it in the sense it activates the muting system, not triggers aggravation. Did you skim through the conversation or something? It seemed fairly clear. 

    1. First off, I hope you realize I was using sarcasm, i.e. I said it took long in a joking respect, in actuality saying it doesn't take her any time, time equaling effort. I feel like there's a lot of things you're misinterpreting... So, if I didn't change the subject, because, once more, amount of time establishes effort, your point is...? 

    2. No, you like being too literal is the problem here... My apologies if I don't put it in the concisest terms for you, because you like taking everything for face value. 

    3. It appears you're the one moving the goalposts here, because the fact is you said she was consistent, not taking into account anything but your areas of focus. Therefore, you're initial statement, she's been consistent over 5-6 years is still wrong, and you're trying to seem less wrong, saying your areas of focus she's been consistent. She's still not been consistent, regardless of how important the places she's tried advertising are. End of story. 

    4. I'm being completely honest. I didn't even read the link, because I said I wasn't going to, and whether or not you decide to listen is not my problem. 

    5. There's some of the childish behavior I mentioned... Regardless, you're moving goalposts, because my point was, go ahead and find it, she's not liking anything. If you want to believe she's one of those thumbs up, in the sea of them, you're simply trying to be optimistic, because it's highly unlikely. 

    6. "No, you didn't," he says, without providing any reason, at all... Well, I guess you answered my question, in the most childish way possible... If I say don't put a certain word in the comments, are you going to put it in to be cute, like you've done this entire time? 

    Okay, compare this reply to yours, and judge between them. 

    If you post incredibly vague quotes, without any context, and you give a simple reply, without backing it up, a. no one has any idea what you're talking about, and b. even if they did, you still have zero rationale to back you up past disagreeing... "Why is this wrong?" someone questions. CaptHayfever replies, "It just is." 

    As a technicality, 3 strikes are used for showing you messing up three times. Therefore, you're saying you messed up 3 times... Very nice... I'm guessing you've been absent for the past few months, too, thinking that's the only reason...﻿

    communityband1: I'm going to emphasize this in the beginning, given the length of this response is likely going to lessen your desire to look as far into the later topics as you go, and the last topic is arguably the most important. 

    Actually, I think I was overthinking this one, and all of the questions you posed can be answered quite easily. 

    "You have not explained why Lindsey would seek help from a therapist to deal with the pain she was struggling with. You have not explained how she could feel pain at all. You haven't explained how she could fall in love. I can not take you seriously if you don't admit that Lindsey feels a huge range of emotions."

    You're taking my words too literally. When I say she only cares about fame and money, there's the face value, the one you're taking, making it seem like it's exactly how it sounds, or the actual sense, she can have a wide variety of emotions, but her focus is primarily on fame and money, everything else is secondary. I'll pose this question to you. If she had to give up her fame for her boyfriend, are you willing to say she would, given how long it took her to get it? Do you think she could live with a simpler life, not making millions, not having fans adoring her, and step out of the spotlight? It seems very, very unlikely, given the quote the gave from her. "I feel my heart racing, I see the faces in the audience smiling, and I remember the moment I thought, 'I have to make this my life.'" What was that last part? "I have to make this my life.'" The career she has, the fame and money it revolves around, is her life, her primary focus, and push comes to shove, all she really cares about. 

    If it's the very next thing she posts, and I'll point out it's happened faster than a day or two, it's still coming off as buttering up fans for gain, making it seem less deliberate, but still doing it.  

    You're looking at it from the most technical view. Yes, technically, you get a good feeling, which is satisfying a need to be positive, technically, in a way, being selfish. However, between expecting money to inevitably result or feeling a satisfaction from being positive are on two entirely different plains. 

    How is that pure, expecting something in return for fake sincerity and niceness? 

    It's not only her album... She expects people to pay for her merchandise, i.e. no effort on her end, labor on her end, only monetary gain, too. 

    Does it bug you, my honesty? If I think someone is a sheep, which word would you feel better hearing as an alternative? 

    If I'm not going off your writing, I'm going off what exactly? You're writing is literally all I have to base this on, being you're not Lindsey, and there's no other avenues to explore. 

    I didn't dismiss it. It still falls under one of those categories of selfishness, and, as far as her concerts, MONEY IS INVOLVED. 

    Those weren't the standards I was talking about... I'd rather not get into the standards I was talking about. 

    I'm not... ugh... I'm not talking about God... I'm talking about being taught something which is inherently wrong, but religion says it's right... 

    So, I'm guessing culture affected you differently, or are you implying mine got messed up someplace, given my morality views on Lindsey aren't yours? 

    It's roughly the same question. You're going to tell me culture established my morality? 

    I'm pretty sure she said it was Devin Graham being the reason she is where is today, and I'm pretty sure she was a complete failure prior to him, as well, given she said so in her book, you know, the one she wrote, on her life... Doesn't seem any more concrete than that...  

    1. You've proposed a circumstance, which, although you would assume would be so simple, if my mind was to stay the same, to simply abandon everything Lindsey. Yet, the problem is created with things you nor I have any influence over. It was announced Lindsey would be joining Dancing with the Stars for season 25, this season. I watch that show... What am I expected to do? "Well, Lindsey's on, better change the channel. Well, I changed the channel, but they still mentioned her, still panned in on her past her performance. I'm going to pretend I never saw that, I guess..." As I sit in a restaurant, a Lindsey Stirling song plays. "Well, I guess I better put my hands over my ears like a weirdo, singing "la la la" to myself until it's over..." As I enter a store to buy something. "Ah, yet another Lindsey Stirling song. I guess I better do the same thing..." It's impossible to avoid Lindsey, because, like some otherworldly force is getting kick off this, she finds a way to intertwine herself in even the most basic of places I try to avoid thinking about her, this mess. What am I expected to do in all of those scenarios without closure to this, because I can't ignore her, being she's found her way in not only the places I go to eat and shop, but she's moved onto the programs I watch? I had a feeling she'd wind up joining the show, but I dreaded it, because it's one of my favorites, and I'm not going to stop watching it because she's on the show. It's not fair to me. So, communityband1, in all your wisdom, do tell me how I'm dealing with this series of circumstances I have no control over. I'm really curious.﻿

    So you want me to let it go, let it go, don't bold the text anymore?

    "You completely warped my mentioning of triggers" 
    Yes. Yes, I did. :) 

    1) "I hope you realize I was using sarcasm, i.e. I said it took long in a joking respect, in actuality saying it doesn't take her any time, time equaling effort." 
    --First of all, I knew you were being sarcastic, & my response was CLEARLY based on that. Learn to read.
    Secondly, I just spelled out to you in simple words that even YOU could understand how it actually DID take a lot of time. Learn to read.
    Third, I also just established that time DOESN'T necessarily equal effort. Learn to read.
    And finally, sarcasm doesn't translate very well in plain text, especially in situations like this thread where Poe's Law is clearly in effect. That's one of the reasons WHY people use text formatting on the internet. Learn to write. 

    2) "No, you like being too literal is the problem here..."
    --Wrong. If I was "changing the topic" before, then you were clearly changing the topic here, since you did the EXACT SAME THING that I did. 
    http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia

    3) This all started because you were complaining about her content on YouTube. Then you bring Twitter into the discussion out of the blue.

    4) http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure

    5) "she's not liking anything." 
    --Get this through your thick head: It's literally impossible for you to know that. It's literally impossible for you to know that. It's literally impossible for you to know that. It's literally impossible for you to know that. Do not respond until you understand what that sentence means. I won't hold my breath.
    "If I say don't put a certain word in the comments, are you going to put it in to be cute, like you've done this entire time?"
    --It's not to be cute; it's to show that I don't actually take you seriously at all. :D

    "I'm guessing you've been absent for the past few months, too"
    --That makes no sense (& thus nothing based on it can possibly make sense). This video is less than a month old, I appeared in this comment thread 3 weeks ago, and you already know that I've been upvoting comments this entire time. Do you even read what you write before you post it?

    "do tell me how I'm dealing with this series of circumstances I have no control over."
    --I know this wasn't addressed to me, but I have a simple solution: Never leave your house, watch television, read newspapers, or go on the internet. Then big bad Lindsey can't get you! 
    (In all seriousness, if this is all bothering you that much, just do what the thinking world does when media tries to shove Kardashians down our throats: *Ignore it & get on with your life.*)﻿

    CaptHayfever: No, as I said, keep using it, enjoy yourself. 

    Well, there's a shock, admitting something, proves you're willing to warp responses for your gain... 

    1. You said learn to read twice in the same point... Learn not to be redundant... Also, if the ellipsis are used, sarcasm translates perfectly fine. Plus, it has nothing to do with learning to write, as novelists, playwrights, and the like could fail just as easily to translate sarcasm. It's a style, not an inability to write cleanly and with proper grammar. You're wrong. Nice try... You also didn't prove anything, because it still takes her no effort, based on the real-life knowledge I have on the subject, which you so quickly chose to try to disregard, as it proved you wrong. 

    2. It's not changing the topic, only providing rationale to the same topic. Ah, look, yet another link I'm not reading... Well, the blue is pleasing to the eyes, anyway...  

    3. You've changed the goalposts 3 times for point 3... Congratulations... This whole point was started by me saying she increased ads in the past year, Twitter used an example for evidence. You've changed it 3 times, you've lost 3 times, because you can't admit you lost. This proves any argument with you is pointless, given you bounce around... 

    4. Ah, and yet one more link still... I'm glad you enjoy wasting your time. I'll outline this for you. I'd go to the link, prove you wrong, and you'd come back with another, like a never ending cycle. So, for the 3rd or 4th time, I'm not wasting my time. 

    5. It's equally impossible for you to say she is, and the only outlying factor in this, her specialized icon, which anyone can see, is the same one she doesn't use. Therefore, the chances of her liking something are favoring my side more than your side. I'm glad you didn't hold your breath. You need as much oxygen going to the tiny jellybean you call a brain inside your head... The feeling is reciprocated. The difference is you're the one who's looking like the child... 

    You've been in other arguments in the past, over several months. Yes, I read everything I write, but you're too dimwitted to understand simple logic. What a shock. You're wrong still... Huh, this is too easy... I'm thinking comparing you to wall was too complimentary, a speck of dirk, perhaps... As a side note, notice you didn't mention the strike 3 comment. I didn't forget you made yourself look dim... 

    If you have nothing even remotely intelligent to say, why bother getting in the mix of something not addressed to you? As if me spending my time on this, on you, wasn't enough to prove "ignoring it" wasn't possible, I don't think anything else will... If someone has a problem in life, they're upset, dealing with something, this relates to anyone, your logic is ignore it? A fine role model you'd be, a fine human being your are... Well, this person is upset they're pet passed away. CaptHayfever: "Ignore it." I guess Lindsey should've ignored her anorexia, too? Yes, would've worked out so well for her, if she had... Do you read the things you're writing? Do you realize you sounded like a completely hallow person? Do you understand the fact there are some things you should never ignore, given the worst things happen if they are ignored? There's very little excuse you have for such a warped way of thinking. I'm sarcastic, insulting, but, to say something on your caliber, like that ignorant comment, I'd have to be on a whole new level of shallow, one you've proven you've already reached... If... when... you reply, I'll read your comment, but I'm not going back and forth with a thing like you. You're not even worth the sarcasm, and, when I don't respond to your garbage, who's really more mature? Of course, you could stop here yourself, show some sign of maturity, the little you have left to gain after your remark, which isn't enough to fill a bottle cap, but I'd imagine it's much too hard for you to keep your mouth closed...﻿

    Nah, it'd be easy to keep my mouth shut. It just wouldn't be any fun!

    1) That's not what ellipsis means. Learn to write.
    Novelists, playwrights, and the like use text formatting. Learn to read.

    I was speaking from first-hand experience of actually producing visuals with other people and syncing video to separate audio. You were speaking from something your friend who makes isolated audio tracks entirely on their own said. That's not the same thing. Learn to read.

    5) I never argued from an affirmative position of "she is liking posts". I don't know whether she's liking posts. It's literally impossible for me to know whether she's liking posts. Likewise, it's literally impossible for YOU to know either, so your continued insistence that you're absolutely certain she isn't, based on zero evidence, is kinda hilarious.

    "You've been in other arguments in the past, over several months."
    --Then why ask whether I've been absent, since you already knew it wasn't true?

    "As a side note, notice you didn't mention the strike 3 comment."
    --Yeah, 'cause I didn't care, 'cause I'm not taking this anywhere nearly as seriously as you are.

    "If someone has a problem in life, they're upset, dealing with something, this relates to anyone, your logic is ignore it?"
    --Unless being exposed to Lindsey Stirling on TV qualifies as "a problem in life", something you're "dealing with" that makes you "upset", then this question is completely freaking irrelevant.

    "I guess Lindsey should've ignored her anorexia, too?"
    --Unless that qualifies as a "series of circumstances she had no control over" akin to seeing celebrities that you don't like on TV, then this question is completely freaking irrelevant.

    "Do you understand the fact there are some things you should never ignore, given the worst things happen if they are ignored?"
    --Unless seeing celebrities you don't like on TV would cause the "worst things" to happen, then this question is completely freaking irrelevant.

    "Do you realize you sounded like a completely hallow person?"
    --Do you realize that you just compared seeing celebrities you don't like on TV with anorexia and death?

    "There's very little excuse you have for such a warped way of thinking."
    --There's very little excuse you have for comparing seeing celebrities you don't like on TV with anorexia and death.

    "I'm not going back and forth with a thing like you."
    --Prove it.﻿

    Wow... this is still a thing. After like 2 months of time in-between, I go to watch a LindseyTime video, and I find the unmistakable negativism of John Avery in the first few comments of otherwise positive fans, and, front and center, I find communityband1 still arguing with him over the same stuff, for like fifty comments, still showing no signs of stopping. This is probably one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, the length of something like this going on for so long, over the span of several videos. However, having read everything on this, trying my very best to keep everything in mind, not as a sheep, there are some things I have to say to you, John. 

    First and foremost, everything you say, everything you assert as evidence, in my mind, boils down to one real issue, mindset. Everything you've mentioned she is, her personality, her morality, her character, is the result of nothing else but you're mindset, because your mindset is to view everything about her with lingering doubt or, in most cases, take the side of pessimism. If Lindsey says something nice to her fans, your mind jumps to the conclusion she's expecting some type of eventual gain. If everyone chose to think like this, every person on this planet would be in doubt of gratitude being real. Lindsey's post on Instagram, coincidentally, on this very day, sums up her sincerity. Lindsey didn't post her gratitude, because she's expecting everyone who'll witness the photo to be "buttered up," leading them to buy something. Lindsey posted her message, because she's grateful for the life and success she's been given, by the same fans she's expressing her thoughtful and genuine appreciation to, not for the expectancy of monetary gain. It's not a question of being a "sheep," or "I'm giving her the benefit of doubt," it's because my mindset isn't hardwired to find some way of making her words seem like they have some ulterior motive. 

    Secondly, we'll move on to your assertion she no longer comments on anything, likes anything. I guess you didn't take the initiative to try to find them, only assumed she didn't, again, because your mindset is already convinced she stopped. I did, and I not only found one comment she left, but I found two, on the same day, yesterday, not months ago, not years ago, yesterday. You'll likely jump to your usual drawback "it's because she's trying to play the game of faces for her millions of fans." Yet, in actuality, only a few hundred people are aware of the video's existence, and she didn't make any effort to share this on Twitter or anything, meaning she not only took the time to make this random person happy, she didn't do it to publicly come off as charitable, either. She literally just did it out of the kindness of her heart. There's no way to spin this one, because nothing about her actions were for anything but being nice to one of her fans, one of many you say she's forgotten, doesn't care about, doesn't communicate with, and doesn't expect anything but for them to buy something as a result. It's none of my business to question the reason she stopped on her own account's videos, but the notion you presented is completely wrong, because it's there to view, on her liked playlist. Plus, as likely or unlikely as it is, CaptHayfever, whom I grateful to for pointing this out, made me realize Lindsey could be one of those people liking my comment, other fans' comments. Yes, as you said, and your not wrong, it would be cooler to see the little heart icon next to a comment. Personally, I'd love it, but, if she still comments on videos, she could be liking them. It's up to your way of viewing things to decide if she is or isn't, and everyone is aware you're not picking the optimistic one. Why? Your mindset. 

    There's also your claims her fans are being taken advantage of, because she's using their love for the ultimate goal of getting their money or praise. Lindsey's fans owe her, I owe her, an extraordinary amount of gratitude, for giving them, giving me, the inspiration to aspire to be something, providing cheerfulness with her music in the midst of troubling times, moments of sadness, moments of weakness. Did she have any impact on my choice to get those things from her music? Did she have any direct influence on me to buy her music in the first place? No, I did that myself, like the rest of her fans, like you did. She didn't take advantage of my trust. I put my trust in her, and the little I can give back to her, for indirectly making me happy, giving me hope, through her music and words, is solely my decision. I'm not going to buy a Sprocket or RiMe, even though she partnered with both of them. Your supposition is based solely on your frankly insulting view someone is a mindless Lindsey Stirling follower, and they'll buy everything she advertises, which is ludicrous. Plus, if it gives them some sense of joy, who are you to say it's wrong? 

    There's the meet-and-greet argument you've mentioned, her fans having to pay to speak to her, for her to acknowledge them. Well, seeing as she's commented on other people's videos, I guess not... However, if I'm able to get to give my hero a hug, which I'll highlight she's one of the few people I know who still gives her fans hugs, I'm completely willing to pay for the opportunity, and it's not selfish on her part, because I'm WILLINGLY spending my money to meet her in person WITHOUT her having any influence on my decision. 

    This one is incredibly simple. Everyone gets the message. You didn't like Brave Enough. Did Shatter Me and Lindsey Stirling cease to exist? Did the messages they represented become any less meaningful? Are you diminishing their value by choosing to harp on Brave Enough as if it's her only album? Did any of the videos she produced for both albums, the level of creativity she showed, her ingenuity, suddenly become any less thought-provoking or deep? Well? Everyone also gets the message you don't like the idea of her Christmas album. You're one of the only ones, and the solution is simple to this one, too. Don't buy the album! This is an exceptionally intelligent move on her part, because it's a source of income, every holiday season, and it will be around long after her main album is taken off the shelves for newer music. Plus, you have no idea if she'll wind up making one of those songs better than the original person who made it a hit. 

    Okay, let's move on to something else, your notion she's obsessed with money. I get the impression you're under the assumption she drives around in a Lamborghini, eating caviar, in some lavish mansion, with her gold-encrusted violin by her side. Lindsey is trying to make a stable living, and she's not nearly as rich as you're choosing to believe she is, either. Yes, she made roughly 6 million dollars in one year. In today's day and age, you're not living in opulence with 6 million dollars. A house can be over a million, and it won't be a mansion, either. Plus, she's never flaunted money, given off the impression of being a rich snob, and she's still working her bum off, trying to make a living. Lindsey was South America this entire month, touring the continent to put on shows. Did you expect her to film a cover in the midst of this tour? How incredibly easy for you to say, oh he who is not dancing around on a stage for over an hour, moving from one place to the next, with hardly enough time to enjoy for himself, or is Lindsey not supposed to enjoy any part of her day, only work during her free time? 

    Lindsey's on Dancing with the stars. Fantastic! It's her MAKING THE MOST OUT OF HER LIFE. What do you expect? She's supposed to be a dancing violinist on YouTube and nothing else? Do you not realize, given she can dance unbelievably, this is something she's more than capable of being able to win? Plus, excuse her for trying different things... 

    This is important. You mentioned this event, this moment of clarity, in which you noticed something about Lindsey being off. At this time, did you attempt to give her the benefit of the doubt, or, at the very least, did you look for evidence to contradict your supposed realization? Honestly, based on the information you've given in the past, you never even tried to give Lindsey, the person you said you owed so much to, the one you called your hero, the person you claimed you were a fan of, a chance. You, like so many I've seen, with this one thought in your mind, turned on her, as if everything she did meant nothing. Lindsey's entire life is under a magnifying glass, and some people treat her so harshly, take everything she does for granted. Yet, she still shows gratitude, still treats her fans with respect, and is still willing to give up so much of her life to make people she doesn't even know happy. What, in any of that, is selfish? "It's because she loves fame and money from them." No, it's because she's a sweetheart, she is grateful, and she deserves the money for the sacrifices she's made, for everyone, even ungrateful people like you. Lindsey's not the selfish one, not the morally backwards one. The title of selfish, backwards, and lying person belongs to you, and if you think your life, and anything you may have gone through justifies your actions, you are so very wrong. I have plenty unfortunate experience in life myself, but notice I'm not insulting Lindsey or her fans. You created this monster, and you never tried to stop it before it got too big. Even now, YOU only feed it, not Lindsey. I'm glad communityband1 never quit arguing with you, because you need someone else to put you in your place. Don't pretend you're some hero, protecting fans against Lindsey. Lindsey is the hero in all of this, not you.﻿

    Attempted_Logic: Did you enjoy relieving your frustration, writing a small piece of literature to vent...? 

    I'm fully aware of the comment she left on her Instagram, and if that's your best justification she's not being insincere, a speedily taken photo, coupled with words of "gratitude," you're nearly as dimwitted as the rest of the sheep I find, taking every word she says with no consideration of foresight... 

    Yes, she did comment on two videos, both of them covers, i.e. people stroking her ego. I am surprised by the fact you were able to find them, but, saying she wasn't letting the public know, isn't entirely the case, as, if you spend five minutes on her Twitter, you'll find the one person who's video she commented on was the one she also replied to, proving, although to a lesser extent than leaving a link to the video, she was letting people know. I figured it out this way. I'm beginning to question if you found it, or you're lying, and that's the way you found it yourself... It still boils down to something selfish, as always... Nice try, though... Also, your mindset is exactly like the rest of the sheep, and pessimism isn't mine, only realism. Of course, you're going to think she's liking your comment, too... It's not happening, but enjoy living in fantasy land... 

    You also seem to forget, or you chose to not acknowledge, I found proof people buying things solely for the fact it's Lindsey related. I'm able to say it's wrong, because it's still an underhanded tactic, and, if they're able to get some misplaced joy out of a printer, which is a sad statement in and of itself, isn't the point... 

    There you go with hug thing again... Do you have some obsession with hugging? Do you go out and hug any random person you find, or are you genuinely this fixated on getting a hug from Lindsey, the most expensive hug you'll have ever gotten, running you closer to three hundred than two, and the most insincere one ever... So, fantastic, you won't buy a Sprocket, but you'll willingly waste more than a quarter of a thousand dollars for a fake hug and five seconds left to say some sheepish thing to her, like "You're such an inspiration for me, my hero," as if she's paying any attention to those words... 

    It has nothing to do with Shatter Me and Lindsey Stirling never existing, only the fact her music is going from bad to worse. You tried to keep everything in mind, huh? How about keeping the issues straight... 

    Well, if she's making of cover of Beauty and the Beast while on tour in America, I guess she could've made one in South America, too, huh? Also, yes, I definitely think she's living in opulence, because I definitely put something even close to such an indication in anything I've ever written... No, she's greedy, trying every last tactic or simply spamming to get more money... She's working real hard, too, reuploading videos... 

    When did I say that, exactly? I'm guessing you enjoy putting words in my mouth? The fact is I watch the show, and she's going to be on the show, which is going to be like jamming a fire poker in my side every single time they pan over to her... 

    It still comes with the territory, your life being under a magnifying glass, and it's not something you shouldn't be already expected to experience. Did I ever consider myself a hero? No, but you decided to put words in my mouth, saying I thought I was, like half of your sheepish comment. If you feel like being a sheep, buying every lie she tells, pretending she's a "sweetheart," (I notice you love referring to her as this, all the time...) still, with the obvious cracks in the paint, considering her your hero, spending your money on some shallow hug, as I've ascertained, you're obsession, as said I before, enjoy living in fantasy land... Lindsey has no idea you exist, not unless you pay her, and even then, you fade into her memory faster than she can count the money she got out of you, the only thing you're good to her for, monetary gain. I'm not trying to be a hero, only be the one to point out those cracks in the paint. It's up to you to decide if you feel like listening to logic... I suppose your name is ATTEMPTED _Logic for a reason. You attempt it, but you fail at it, using sheep logic... You have experience in life? Where does that seem familiar? Ah, yes, communityband1 has said the same thing... I'm so happy for you, too, being glad he's keeping this up, because you're the only one... Seriously, if I hear any more of your sheepish complimentary garbage, I'm going to sick, the same If I hear you say you're dream is to give Lindsey a hug one more time... What was the number, roughly eight hundred sheep liking your pathetic post about the same thing you can't seem to keep your trap closed from saying? Do you think Lindsey liked that post? I'll bet you do, even if it's the furthest thing from the truth... It's not pessimism, either. It's being realistic... As I've said to other parties involved, if you have nothing intelligent to say, do keep your mouth closed, because no one feels like listening to your sheep logic and hug fixation...﻿

Even though I disagreed, he kept my respect, and I responded to him accordingly. There's a very simple reason that person kept my respect & you have not: Regardless of whether you're right or wrong, you're an arrogant, insufferable edgelord with a massive superiority complex. Accordingly, there's no insult on earth which would hurt you more than simply speaking the truth--I don't take you seriously at all. I'm still not sure whether you're just trolling or whether you're sincerely that narcissistic, but either way, I'm getting nothing but laughs out of this conversation.﻿

    John, you asked what you're expected to do when presented with things that remind you of Lindsey. We expect the same of you as of ourselves. What do people do when their relationships end against their will and they still have to interact with those they love? How do people get over addictions when constantly presented with temptation? How do people cope when they don't feel anyone cares about them? Everyone experiences these things.

    To cope, we invest in ourselves and force our focus onto positive things - our work, hobbies, friendships... It begins as a losing battle. Our thoughts are constantly interrupted by what we're trying to forget. But we force ourselves to continually reset our focus where we want it, and without exception, it gets easier over time. As long as we don't give into temptation and revert, it gets easier.

    Society expects us to do all we can to move on, regardless of the merits of our pain. If a boy's father abandons him and his mother for another woman and moves across the country, he can not spend years of his life dwelling for hours a day upon a lost opportunity to express how angry he is. For a while, he'll be reminded of abandonment every time he comes home from school to a house with a missing dad. But he has to move on and focus on things that help him grow. He has to focus on the positive things in his life and be grateful for them. The pain fades in time, because there isn't room for it next to the things he makes important.

    Society also expects us to get help when we need it. We aren't always able to get through things on our own. There is never shame in getting help. Lindsey's done it. I've done it. The only shame is in not doing whatever it takes to move forward. Society forgives weakness, but not lack of effort.

    Are you serious about getting over this? What specific steps do you think a professional might suggest? Please don't skip this question.

    "You're taking my words too literally."

    No, I'm really not. Your position has shifted multiple times. In the past you've attempted to defend this literal interpretation. Look back through the last few weeks of posts and ask how often you've admitted she feels other emotions.

    "...but her focus is primarily on fame and money, everything else is secondary." "Do you think she could live with a simpler life, not making millions, not having fans adoring her, and step out of the spotlight?"

    Let's propose scenarios that actually separate these things. Let's take away everything except the fame and the money. Picture Lindsey with the same career she has now, but where she doesn't care about music or enjoy playing the violin. She doesn't like dancing. She doesn't enjoy video production or creating art. She doesn't enjoy her time with the people she works with. She has no friends among the people she spends 75% of her life on the road with. She doesn't care at all about sharing a positive message. She continually puts in 12 to 16 hour days working on things she feels no passion for. But it makes her rich and famous.

    Alternatively, Lindsey can choose a career that brings her neither fame nor fortune, but she loves what she does and loves the people she works with.

    You ask what I think she'd do? She'd go with the latter. Lindsey chose her career with the expectation it would never bring her widespread fame or fortune. She picked a path that statistics told her would result in financial hardship. From where she stood, the only saving grace was that it was what she loved doing. That was enough.

    "If it's the very next thing she posts, and I'll point out it's happened faster than a day or two, it's still coming off as buttering up fans for gain, making it seem less deliberate, but still doing it."

    This answer is disrespectful to me. I take the time to study your claims, and it is unfair for you to offer answers as trivial and dismissive as this. I told you that I looked through every tweet Lindsey made this year, and I explained:

    1. Lindsey does not frequently praise her fans as a whole. On the handful of occasions where she has done so, only a fraction of those have been followed by an advertisement - period. Your argument has been that Lindsey praises people and then tries to sell products to those same people with a separately posted advertisement. It is not happening with any sort of frequency or consistency that would indicate a strategy. Lindsey advertises frequently. Because of this alone, we should statistically expect that posts of gratitude will coincide within a few days of advertisements. And yet it's still infrequent. Most advertisements are shared without any such preceding tweets. There is no indication of a strategy beyond what random chance would predict.

    2. Tweets are not seen by a majority of followers. I took the time to go read up on this for you to help you understand why Lindsey duplicates her tweets. But it also explains why you should not expect many people to see two consecutive posts by the same person. If 20% see her first tweet and only 20% of those people also see the second, we're down to 4%. We should not mathematically expect such a strategy to make a measurable difference in advertising outcome.

    "However, between expecting money to inevitably result or feeling a satisfaction from being positive are on two entirely different plains."

    I agree - emotional satisfaction is on a much higher plane than money, which is why we trade money for it. Please stop dismissing what I've written. I stated that your actions demonstrate very clearly how you sacrifice money to achieve emotional satisfaction. You can stop doing this right now and invest time in things that will increase your wealth. Time is money. You're throwing away money on this highly selfish activity as you seek emotional satisfaction at the expense of others.

    "How is that pure, expecting something in return for fake sincerity and niceness?"

    Show my quote together with this reply.

    "You're writing is literally all I have to base this on..."

    No, it really isn't. Perhaps I'll ask the others. I believe they can see what you overlook.

    "It's not only her album... She expects people to pay for her merchandise, i.e. no effort on her end, labor on her end, only monetary gain, too."

    Of course it's her work. She built the brand and continues to do so. She takes losses on much of her work so she can make gains by performing and selling merchandise. Lindsey's business model is to spend time and money creating things that don't pay for themselves in order to increase the attractiveness of things that do.

    "Does it bug you, my honesty? If I think someone is a sheep, which word would you feel better hearing as an alternative?"

    It's not honesty. You're lying to yourself. You've never spoken to a sheep, or at least a sheep has never spoken back to you. You've never spoken to anyone who is not enormously more complex than this description allows. If this is all you see in someone, you aren't looking hard enough. Pick someone. Let's test it out.

    "I'm talking about being taught something which is inherently wrong, but religion says it's right..."

    Religions don't say anything. Either God says something, or people do. The morals laid out in the Bible are either the words of God or the opinions of people who traveled through life and figured out morality just as you do. 

    "It's roughly the same question. You're going to tell me culture established my morality?"

    I said it heavily influenced it. This is self-evident and has been discussed at length by scholars. Different cultures today express different beliefs about what is moral, and beliefs change through history with and without the influence of religion. Logical deduction didn't lead you to conclude partnering with HP is wrong. That's the work of cultural stereotypes. An unbiased analysis shows the partnership helps all of us. If you change your environment and spend time with economists or business leaders, your views will adapt.

    "I'm pretty sure she said it was Devin Graham being the reason she is where is today..."

    Lindsey's drive created her introduction to Devin. Devin discovered Lindsey through her performance on AGT, and many fans from that show were among the first to support her on YouTube. There isn't a person in the world who can tell us what path Lindsey may have taken without Devin, including Lindsey. The important thing to understand is that she has the qualities we see consistently in success stories, and she created the situation that led to her success. She laid out a blueprint for success in life, with or without fame and fortune. And that's why she is an excellent role model.

    "You also seem to forget, or you chose to not acknowledge, I found proof people buying things solely for the fact it's Lindsey related."

    I dismantled this "proof," and you replied only by complaining about my research. It is very tiring to see you continually back off of discussion points when you dislike the direction and then pull them back in randomly as if they were never addressed. You don't know if they even purchased the game. If they did, you don't know why. You expect us to believe that a gamer who has Liked four of Lindsey's videos over the last five years is so obsessed with Lindsey that she will buy a game for no reason other than to "support" her, and your proof is that she wrote the words, "Now I HAVE to get this game..." No reasonable person will accept this.﻿

    communityband1: The "suggestion" you gave is completely terrible... I'm guessing you completely glanced over the fact she is going to be on one of the things I would use to divert my attention from this mess, or I have to deal with her being played in a store, yet another avenue to divert attention... She finds her way into everything, with nothing on my part, either... Also, what part of the "professional" solution not being viable, because it's failed twice in the past, are you not remembering? The conversation was only a few weeks earlier...

    I explained this entire thing, her being able to feel emotions, but still be focused primarily (care only about) money and fame...

    You're not even answering the question... The fact is she is in a situation with all the things you've said to neglect, for anyone's guess, and she wouldn't step away from it, either... 

    Yes, I noticed your separate post, written in italics. You seem to forget this study is based on statistics on average, not sheep people who literally only follow her, and dedicate the time to viewing everything she's putting up... Plus, I guess you and I are looking on two different accounts, because I witnessed this on 3 separate occasions, within a span of perhaps a few months...    

    Yes, I'm absolutely losing money by spending my time on this... Did it ever once occur to you this isn't my number one priority, and I'm answering this without losing anything but free time? 

    You're completely wrong on this one. Lindsey is continuously making money on her videos, still getting paid for every one, and you have no clue how YouTube works... The business model she uses is ever-paying... 

    Are you kidding me? The runner-up for head sheep is only a few comments above you (Attempted_Logic)... If he isn't a sheep, demonstrating the most pathetic fixation with getting a hug from Lindsey, which is the most perfect example of dimwits wasting money for her fake sincerity, going on about her being a "sweetheart," even if she isn't, etc, I can't think of one... As I said, his "logic" is sheep logic, and the rest of it is venting... Did you notice he's not saying anything in response to me, likely because he realizes he has no ground to stand on with his argument? There's your example a sheep, justly given the title of a sheep from his sheepish reply and sheepish complimentary garbage... 

    "My views will adapt." If anything, my views will only be confirmed, seeing and experiencing the things you can't seem to admit is reality...  

    Seriously? Lindsey can't say the impact someone had on her success? Do you even listen to yourself? 

    Why do I get the impression if she did buy the game, and she said she bought the game because of Lindsey, you still wouldn't buckle on this being the truth. The people agreeing with the claim was substantial enough to gather one of them must've bought the game for Lindsey.﻿

    "I'm guessing you completely glanced over the fact she is going to be on one of the things I would use to divert my attention from this mess..."

    John, I'm not talking about watching television or going to the store. I'm talking about investing yourself in things that are positive and useful to help you grow and force you to develop your mind or body. Go study a new subject and discuss it with people. Learn guitar. Learn software development. Join a sports club. Find an activity on meetup dot com and make new friends. You have to pick things that take you time to develop and allow you to see progress. Pick something that will become part of your identity. And don't let yourself say, "I'm not interested in X, Y, or Z." Nobody is born with interests. We develop them by trying new things.

    "Also, what part of the "professional" solution not being viable, because it's failed twice in the past, are you not remembering?"

    I remembered it perfectly, and I'm still advising it. The insinuation that all therapists are the same is a non-starter. But you have to want to get better. There's not much they can do if you go in with a poor attitude towards them.

    "I explained this entire thing, her being able to feel emotions, but still be focused primarily (care only about) money and fame..."

    You stated your guess, and you proposed an invalid scenario to test it. To determine whether she values fame and money above love, you asked if she would choose her career or her boyfriend. But that's insufficient. Lindsey's career includes many things she loves and is passionate about. So you weren't actually asking if she would choose money and fame. You were asking if she would choose money, fame, and everything and nearly everyone else she cares about. So I fixed it for you. I illustrated a proper scenario comparison where she has to choose between a career doing what she loves with whom she loves vs. a monotonous, strenuous career completely devoid of joy but financially lucrative. That's a fair test because it will tell us how she weighs money and fame against joy. I think it's easy to predict. And I also believe we'll eventually see proof when Lindsey chooses to become a mother. That will likely mean a big hit to her career.

    "You seem to forget this study is based on statistics on average..."

    But Lindsey seems to be operating by statistics, as we see with tweet duplication to reach additional people. She knows that most of her followers won't see any given tweet, but duplication increases the exposure. Lindsey can't reasonably target her advertisements to the tiny fraction who follow her closely. Out of over 500,000 followers, 241 have so far retweeted her latest post, and there are 119 comments, including those from people commenting multiple times. That is much too tiny for an advertising campaign. If you run a website with that kind of traffic daily, you'll be lucky to get any ad revenue at all.

    "3 separate occasions, within a span of perhaps a few months..."

    You're trying to make a case that Lindsey has established a pattern of this behavior, and your reference is 3 tweets over several months? That is not nearly enough to affirm your conclusions. Random chance could predict this outcome, given the number of ads. Lindsey has tweeted a significant number of advertisements and promotions this year. How many of them have not been preceded by a tweet praising or thanking all of her fans? Nearly all. And on the flip side, about half of the tweets that do praise all of her fans are not followed by ads. Your figure of 3 is about the total for the year to date.

    "Did it ever once occur to you this isn't my number one priority, and I'm answering this without losing anything but free time?"

    That's exactly what I assumed. Don't you use your free time to teach yourself new skills that will help your career or to work on hobbies you might turn into a side business? Our free time is our chance to create the opportunity to do what we love for a living. Even if you don't, the point is inarguable. You have the option of using this time to make money, and you are not doing it. This emotional satisfaction you seek at the expense of others is more important to you than the money you abandon.

    "You're completely wrong on this one. Lindsey is continuously making money on her videos, still getting paid for every one, and you have no clue how YouTube works..."

    You did not understand what I said. Lindsey takes a loss on most of her videos. Revenue is not profit. The cost that goes into making most of her videos is not recouped by the advertising revenue for those videos. But the videos do serve to promote her brand and enable her to make more money elsewhere.

    "Did you notice he's not saying anything in response to me, likely because he realizes he has no ground to stand on with his argument?"

    I don't think that's likely at all. If he doesn't respond, I think it will be because he doesn't believe you listen.

    "Seriously? Lindsey can't say the impact someone had on her success? Do you even listen to yourself?"

    And here is what I actually said: "There isn't a person in the world who can tell us what path Lindsey may have taken without Devin, including Lindsey." If Lindsey had not worked with Devin, her life would have unfolded a completely different way. She may have taken up YouTube on her own. She may have partnered with a friend. She may have done something completely unrelated to YouTube. We don't know what her life would have been, and she doesn't either. The only thing we know is that the traits she exhibits lead people to success. Driven people create opportunities, they don't simply wait for them to come along.

    "Why do I get the impression if she did buy the game, and she said she bought the game because of Lindsey, you still wouldn't buckle on this being the truth."

    Paranoia? If two young people who like games talk about getting a game, don't you suspect they intend to play the game? People have much better ways of donating money if that's all they care to do. They can purchase her albums and give them to friends. They can send her a check with a nice personalized letter in the mail. Both of those would result in far better support for Lindsey. 

    This game was never a suitable example for your purposes, because Lindsey was involved with the game's creation. She composed music for it, and some people showed interest in the music itself. In other words it's not just an advertisement for another company's product. Lindsey's work is part of the game, and similar to purchasing her albums, people may buy the game in part to own her music. It's not the same situation as something like the Sprocket.

    "The people agreeing with the claim..."

    I didn't catch when the Like button became an Agree button or when a statement of intent became a claim. It's not as if clicking that Like button means, "Yes, I will purchase this game despite the fact I don't care about it or Lindsey's music... I just want to show Lindsey I support her by giving my money to someone else!" :-)﻿

    communityband1: So, the this conversation comes to a conclusion, as the long-expected quintessence of Lindsey's greed and move to everything generic arrives... It's September, and she decides to use some good old Walmart logic, and release the thing far from the actual holiday itself, put up videos far from the holiday itself, likely this week, because every other artist begins spamming videos about Christmas in September, right... and begin spamming now and never shut up about it for the next several months. Lindsey's logic = "let's see how much money we can get out of this thing in..." It's not about the holidays, not about fans, only using something with a positive message, stepping on it, and twisting it into a money-making greed fest... Welcome to reality. Lindsey is greedy, and this album represents it perfectly, for how she's handling it, and how she's using it... Seriously, most pathetic person on this planet...﻿

    Okay, John, seriously, I've tried to be quiet, tried to keep myself out of this, not to lose my temper as much as possible, and I've tried to be reasonable with you, but, seeing this thing pop up on my notifications, I'm so done. 

    First and foremost, communityband1 and CaptHayfever, I'm sorry for not replying to you earlier. John's ranting and raving comments are simply the worst places to show any type of joy, OR any signs of respect, OR being complimentary towards Lindsey/anyone even remotely supportive of Lindsey or anything she represents. Yes, CaptHayfever, you gave me more than some service. You gave my a really upbeat thought about my comment possibly being liked by Lindsey, because unlike John, I think she reads them, and I'm still super grateful to you bringing it up. It was nice to see you, too ^^ P.S. Apparently, John must not realize bold face is for the very thing you're using it for, and I guess he doesn't like people using things correctly, instead picks fun at anything he finds. I'm as perfectly well as I can manage, communityband1, and I hope you are, too. ^^ You must need some extra-strength Advil after these arguments with someone so unwilling to compromise. If it's any consolation, I find some of the things you post very enlightening, and John must not realize not wigging out isn't unfeeling, it's maturity.  

    Where should I begin, John? I guess I'll start off with my "obsession to get a hug from Lindsey." This isn't pity-party time for me, and I'm only saying it to give you some clarity of your selfishness. It's been nearly 6 years since I could hug anyone, come into contact with anything, because I have OCD, and germophobia resulting from it, which means, I can't touch very much of anything, enjoy very much of anything, and I'm slowing wasting away, because I'm stuck in my own snow globe, fully aware it's not fun here, but finding a difficulty to get out, like Lindsey was with her anorexia. So, to say it's a "fixation," or it's "pathetic," for my dream to hug Lindsey isn't anything close to accurate. It's a hope. I'd love to see my hero in real life, not behind a screen, and give her a hug, not flushing red from my mind burning my skin or my heart beating like a trip-hammer. You say you have such an abundance of life experience. I should hope you understand, then, I can think of no better dream than to give the person I get fleeting happiness from a hug, for giving me hope it's possible but difficult. If I'm pathetic for my hero being Lindsey, and I'm a sheep for my dream to give her hug, given all it'll take, all it represents, you expect too much of me. 

    I've continue with the notion you're weighing your own issues with Lindsey, like her being a television show, against the thousands, millions, of people who're overjoyed. Hmmm... who's being selfish? I never realized the world revolved around you. So, if it's raining, and I message you, can you turn of the rain for me, or do you not take requests? 

    I actually expected to see you mention something about Lindsey's Christmas album, seeing the tweets she put up a few hours ago, but, you took longer than expected... or you weren't near a computer until five seconds before you logged in to YouTube, faster than the speed of sound, to complain... It's likely going to be impossible, given I can't wash away almost six year's worth of my mind's hold, but I would love nothing more than to go to one of her Christmas concerts, and the next time I got the chance, after seeing her and giving her a hug, leaving a mile-long comment underneath yours, saying how amazing it was, how amazing she was, and how nice she was. I would be willing to bet money it would jam one right up in your craw, because joy and happiness to you what salt is to a slug. I will be buying the album, though. Does that bother you? I might buy the signed vinyl, too. How red is your face, now, like a lobster? Seriously, if I manage to see her concert, you are never hearing the end of it, because I'll never shut up. 

    So, from the "runner-up head sheep," enjoy the rest of your morning, afternoon, or evening. John. I've got to look up tour dates :P﻿

    John, you often accuse people of not putting thought into things and simply following along blindly. I suggest this applies here. You accept without question a popular opinion that the pursuit of financial gain in and of itself can be inherently wrong on some deep, undefined and unquestionable level. You state the commonly expressed belief that at some arbitrary point, enough money is enough, and any more than enough is wrong or harmful.

    I can point out that we don't actually know when Lindsey's album will be released. Some people seem to have heard late October. I can point out that two of the most popular Christmas albums of all time - and my own personal favorites, the Mannheim Steamroller albums - were released in August and September. I can note that to be practical, Lindsey must announce tour dates well in advance for people to fit them into their schedules, especially during the holiday season, and announcing the tour dates without also announcing the album that matches the tour content might make less sense.

    But if I focus on those things, I'll show blind acceptance that there is something fundamentally wrong here which must be justified. It does not stand up to scrutiny. 

    If I sell a million copies of my software, it is incorrect to look at me as the winner and my customers as the losers. We are mutual winners. My customers win because they judged my software to have greater value - not equal - than the money they traded for it. They are also better off having the option to purchase my software, because it allows them to weigh this option against all other options they have.

    If Lindsey releases an album early, and the result is that more people purchase it, then the result from an economist's perspective is that more winners exist. There is no problem of selfishness, because the gain is mutual. For a problem to exist, gain would have to come at the loss of others. That is not how experts view this situation of mutual benefit through trade.

    An economist will explain that if Lindsey makes $25 billion in sales on a Christmas album, it will be a fine thing, because it will mean that over a billion people made a trade that they perceived benefited them and was a better deal than anything else of equal cost. Economists celebrate both choice and trade. If moving a date forward produces more choice and more trade, it's good.

    I believe the popular stigma on this issue stems from the inability to separate out those activities which truly do pursue wealth at the expense of others. For example, a cigarette company clearly hurts people as it makes money. Politicians sometimes seek power by leading people to believe things which aren't true. There are certainly many examples of people pursuing wealth and power to the clear detriment of others. 

    But this is something we must carefully distinguish from the types of activity that make our society work and benefit us all. If we accept that moving society forward to help people is a worthy goal, then we can see there is never a level at which seeking money in and of itself becomes immoral or bad. We earn money by providing service to others. If we make more money, it is because our service reaches and impacts more people. And that's great, because in turn it allows us to invest in other people's services. Lindsey's career is a great example of this. Each time her revenue grew, she invested in more people. This time around, she hired an orchestra. And I have to tell you - instrumentalists need all the work they can get.﻿

    Attempted_Logic: Did anyone prompt you to get involved? If you open your trap, expect nothing less... 

    Whereas I can say I sympathize with your problem, it doesn't excuse the fact you're paying for fake sincerity... Yes, in your mind, it's symbolic of something more, but, boiled down, you're spending money on nothing but generic music and a plastered on smile (if you are, in fact, able manage to overcome something like that, for the worst possible reason imaginable). The way you presented it makes it sound like overcoming something, inspired by Lindsey, for the sake of thanking her for both the happiness you got from her in such times and a sense of gratitude for the hope she provided. It sounds so nice drawn out that way, even if the actual truth is she couldn't care less, and your "hero" is begrudgingly giving you your hug for the sake of appearance, nothing else... Ah, yes, and the money, can't forget the money...  

    How very clever of you... Does it seem selfish? Yes. However, it's still entirely sound. 

    Why, given the fact you made it seem almost impossible, does it seem like you're not going to do that... I'd imagine you'll buy the tickets, but you'll get no further past that point, and you'll have nothing to say about anything, minus the way things could've been... If you waste your money on her album, nice for you... Yet, I fully anticipate you're mentioning viewing tour dates is to be cute, not serious, and not to actually wind up accomplishing, given the small span of time. Perhaps, try to be intelligent with your insults, because you're not fooling anyone...﻿

Also, if people buying cigarettes are doing it of their own volition, and they get what they pay for, something they want, your logic with Lindsey selling printers with the same outcome, I guess it's not different, is it?

    Clearly you think all that matters is making money, then. You think that there's no such thing as a mutually-beneficial monetary transaction. You think that paying for something is inherently being duped. 
    Funny how a person with that mindset would then go & accuse someone else of being solely obsessed with money.﻿

    "It's not equal, because she's the one walking away with the abundance of money, and her fans get some cheap, generic garbage music..."

    Why do you purchase things, John? Do you purchase products that serve no purpose in your life because someone tells you they have value that meets or exceeds the asking price?

    No. You purchase things when you perceive the value of those things in your life exceeds the value of the money you trade. This is economics 101. We don't buy things for their absolute value but for the value we perceive they have for us personally. I could sit down with you and show you how repetitive and generic the music you prefer is compared to more sophisticated offerings and explain how you spend your money on music that doesn't exhibit nearly the workmanship of other offerings. But I would be wrong to do so, because I would fail to understand the only thing that matters. The music's value to you is different than the music's value to anyone else on the planet, and only you can quantify it. The value depends on the purpose you have for it. The value of Lindsey's music to her fans is based on the purpose they have for it - to bring them joy, to listen to while doing homework, to have something to discuss with friends - whatever. They reach the decision to buy the music when they determine its value in their lives is greater than the money it costs.

    And that's how we know gain is mutual: because gain is our prerequisite for purchase. People don't trade money until they believe the sum of the value of what they get in return is greater than the cost. Even in the case of a donation, people give their money when they feel the return is greater than the cost.

    As a side note, I don't share your perspective on the cost value. I could hire an orchestra, rent a studio and record my own Christmas music. But it would cost me more than $15. I also generally agree with the professionals who reviewed her last album.

    "I'm touring, because I want the most money I can get from this..."

    You keep expecting this to bother me. Read my last post again. You ask me to buy into something similar to what you typically characterize as "sheep logic." I dislike that term, because people with this limited view aren't sheep. They simply aren't thinking it through. But please don't believe you will phase me by showing how Lindsey tries to grow her business. I want her to do that, because it helps me and everyone else. This is how economies grow. And because I firmly believe she also understands this basic principle of economics and understands that giving people choices does not harm them, but rather enables them, I have no reason to believe that she would feel she's doing anything wrong. If she's not actually doing anything wrong, and she knows this, then it takes no malice on her part to keep doing what she does. You can't convince me Lindsey is showing malice unless you can convince me that she mistakenly believes her actions are bad for society. For you to be right, Lindsey must believe something that isn't true.

    "Also, if people buying cigarettes are doing it of their own volition, and they get what they pay for, something they want, your logic with Lindsey selling printers with the same outcome, I guess it's not different, is it?"

    People don't die of printer cancer.

    Attempted_Logic and CaptHayfever, if you're reading this, I wonder at times if my thoughts on economics and business seem strange to people. After writing my last post, I discovered an article over at The Economist that was in many ways strikingly similar to what I'd just written. If you're interested, I found it enlightening, and it's written and explained much better than anything I've offered. It's actually a discussion about CSR (corporate social responsibility), but it goes into detail on many topics I touched upon. It draws a clear distinction between self-interest and greed which may be particularly relevant. http://www.economist.com/node/3555259﻿

    communityband1: So, essentially, you're justification is sentimental value establishes actual value, the two being entirely different things... 

    If I go up to a car salesman, and I say, "This car isn't going to be sentimental to me, and therefore, I should get a discounted price," he's not only going to think I'm nuts, he's going to keep the price as it is, it's established value... Lindsey's established value of her album is roughly twelve dollars, and this value doesn't change because of its sentimental value to anyone. So, she, being the primary receiver of the money, is walking away with thousands of dollars, and her fans, individually, get a CD they paid twelve for, or more, but it's probably worth an upwards of eight or less, given it's production value is going to be cheaper than the sale price... It could be priceless in sentimental value, but it's worth it's sticker price. Welcome to actual Economics 101... I genuinely hope you never got into business past selling hot dogs... 

    Yes, Mr. Economics, I'm trying to bother you by saying the way things are, her being greedy... Also, sheep logic is following the lines of doing and listening to everything the Sheppard (in this case Lindsey) says without any consideration of anything else or anyone else. So, if someone doesn't listen to my reason, or they present any "logic" with the notion of blind benefit of the doubt for Lindsey, they're using sheep logic. You've used this, as too have ninety percent of the people I've spoken to in the past. 

    Ah, so we're qualifying it like that, huh? I thought nothing else mattered, so long as people were able to get the product they want, of their own volition, according to you. Suddenly, there's other factors involved. How convenient... So, I guess if the printer turns out to be useless, because it's not causing cancer, it's fine... You love changing things around. Don't you? 

    What are you even doing? Did this become a college class? As if anyone feels like reading your "interesting" articles... 

    Also, not addressed to me, but "it must be really frustrating..." There's some of that unfeeling nature of yours...  Did you notice I said sympathize with the problem. You make it seem like he can't put up a picture frame in his house... Even though I reasoned Lindsey shouldn't be his hero, called him out on his nonsense, being chances are completely low he'll manage to see her live in the near future (as he even pointed out), and he's wasting his money on a fake hug from someone who couldn't care less, I didn't belittle the problem itself...

    Well, John, aren't you so thoughtful, picking fun at my hero being Lindsey, my dream to give her a hug being a waste to you, and making the whole thing seem like a money-making scheme by Lindsey, but you sympathize with me (insert my eyes rolling). Also, could you maybe not bring me into the conversation like that, to prove some theory you've had since like halfway through this discussion about communityband1 being unfeeling? There's nothing unfeeling about the way it's worded. Give me a second while address that, by the way. 

    Honestly, communityband1, I don't want to turn this into a "me thing," because my issue was only brought up to prove John was being inconsiderate. The answer to your question is no, though. I'm kind of in this "perfect vicious cycle," making the entire scenario sort of... "stuck." It's hard to explain without going into detail, but it's like every possible way to fix it is prevented by the problem itself, much as I wish I could. It's the reason Lindsey makes me so happy, because a new video kind of makes my month ^^ I appreciate the concern, though :) I gave the article you posted a look, and I did notice some similarities, although my brain kind of shuts down with an overload of information, especially with accounting, business, economics, or math. I have no trouble leaving your knowledge on the subject, easily exceeding mine, to handle any and all of John's related comments.  

     Actually, while I'm busy digressing, and John probably doesn't want to hear my "sheep logic" anyway, I had no idea Lindsey still commented on stuff on her channel, CaptHayfever. Awesome :D  

    John, moving back to you, you aren't taking into account Lindsey's tour in a broken down respect. You get a signed poster. The online seller prices varies, but it can be fairly expensive, and it's an exclusive poster. You get to see an hour-long+ show, where Lindsey's creating a dynamic atmosphere of both expert dancing and music. You get to see a private performance, a q/a, and the best part, you get to meet her in person, which, for mostly any fan, is one of the best moments in their entire life (insert your snide comment about it being for money here). If anything, you're getting the deal, and Lindsey's not getting enough. As for the album, I'll say this another time for you. It's everyone's choice, and, if they don't think it's a waste, it's not a waste, which is pretty much what I think communityband1 means (correct me if I'm wrong). I've never been persuaded by Lindsey to buy her album. I buy it, because I want to support her, love her music, while still being able to say if I don't like a song of hers, and it makes me happy. Ew... I forgot you don't like happiness :/﻿

    "So, essentially, you're justification is sentimental value establishes actual value, the two being entirely different things..."

    The term is "perceived value." And no, it does not establish "actual value," but exists separately from it.

    "The actual value of an item is a measure that is related to the cost that it takes to produce it and sell it for a profit. For example, when a product is manufactured and sold without any brand names or promises, the actual value is the amount that it would go for in the open market. The actual value is what the product is actually worth without any expectations from the customer or the seller."

    "The perceived value is very different from the actual value of a product. The perceived value is what a customer believes the product is worth. This perception is formed by the opinions of the market and by the benefits that the customer expects to receive if he makes a purchase. The product may be sold for much more than what it cost to manufacture because of the perception of the customer. In some cases, the perception of the value may be less than what the actual value of the product is."

    "The perceived value of a product also impacts purchasing decisions. If the perceived value of the product is greater than the actual price, the customer is more willing to buy. For example, if the customer believes that a particular shirt should cost $50, and he sees it for sale for $20, he is more likely to purchase it. If the perceived value and the price are closer, the urgency for the purchase disappears."

    "If I go up to a car salesman, and I say, 'This car isn't going to be sentimental to me, and therefore, I should get a discounted price,' he's not only going to think I'm nuts, he's going to keep the price as it is, it's established value... Lindsey's established value of her album is roughly twelve dollars, and this value doesn't change because of its sentimental value to anyone."

    This is demonstrably false. The price of the vehicle and of Lindsey's album are both heavily influenced by their perceived value to customers. In point of fact, many people walk into car dealerships, argue that a vehicle is worth less to them than its asking price, and drive away in that car after paying less than what was initially asked. If a significant portion of Lindsey's target market perceives that her album is worth less than $12 but is willing to pay $10, she may easily see the opportunity to make more money by lowering the price. Perceived value has an enormous impact on price.

    As consumers, we typically care much more about perceived value than actual value. Take a movie ticket as an example. If there's a movie you've waited years to see, you may easily decide that a theater ticket is worth $10 to you. But after you watch it once, twice, or five times, how much is the ticket worth to you now? Are you still willing to pay $10 for it? Probably not. The actual value of the ticket has not changed, because it is associated with the cost of the production of the movie. But the perceived value of that ticket to you has diminished greatly. It's the same reason you don't go to the grocery store and buy their entire stock of muffins.

    In fact, except for the situations where we purchase things we intend to resell for equal or greater money, such as stocks or bonds, we almost always pay prices that exceed the the actual value, i.e. the cost of production. If it wasn't for the value we perceive in most things we buy, we would never make these decisions.

    "So, if someone doesn't listen to my reason..."

    But why should we make you our shepherd? Adopting your worldview would spell destruction for humanity. Forget sheep - I don't want to be a lemming. Animal analogies (animalogies?) aside, you ask us to accept what you say despite your complete unwillingness to entertain any expert input. You show you are willing to put an indefinite amount of time into argument, but the minutes it would take to learn new things and make this endeavor add real value to your person are of no interest to you. If there is expert input that can change your understanding of the world or even potentially end this discussion, you seem uninterested or even angry.

    "...they're using sheep logic. You've used this..."

    Oh? Which statements have I never backed up?

    "Suddenly, there's other factors involved. How convenient..."

    There's nothing sudden about this. I've distinguished between good and bad actions of companies on multiple occasions in this thread alone. Although to be perfectly honest, I don't think we should set standards that suggest the introduction of new facts or ideas becomes taboo after 146 posts... ;-)

    "So, I guess if the printer turns out to be useless, because it's not causing cancer, it's fine..."

    If the printer is useless, the market rejects it, people return it for refund, and the price plummets before it disappears from shelves. This is how a market economy works, and it is by far the best system we've found. Do people at times purchase things they later decide has less value to them than they originally perceived? Of course, and when this happens, they may sell or return the product, and they change the way they evaluate products in the future. This is by far the best system, because it puts each of us in control over the determination of value for every product as it applies to our own lives. The consequences of what you propose are devastating. You suggest that we should take away consumer choice when we personally feel the value for everyone else does not add up according to our own personal standards.

    The distinction between this and the example of a company selling cigarettes is explained in the article I linked. When there are external factors that lie outside of the basic value determination between customers and providers, there is potential for trouble. In this case, a consumer may be perfectly content with the perceived value of a pack of cigarettes. But long term the cigarettes may cause damage that isn't reflected in this valuation. Some people abuse this and hurt individuals and society as a whole. This is a very different scenario that we must identify and guard against.

    "As if anyone feels like reading your "interesting" articles..."

    I think many people would decide they're better off reading that article than this discussion. Also, you complain when we share links. You've shown you'll accept nothing we say, so showing you what some experts say seems worth a try.

    And that sort of begs the question: whom do you listen to?﻿

    Attempted_Logic, yeah, I'm sorry for asking about it here, since this isn't the place. But I really hope you find a way out of that. I know how entrapping our minds can be, and I actually do have a little sense of what it's like to become preoccupied with that thing in particular. I doubt there's anything I could do to help, but if you'd like someone to chat with separately, I'm up for it.

    John, I know you dislike me, but I would like to offer the same to you. If there's something I can help you get into that could help you take your mind off things - playing an instrument, learning programming, etc. - I'd see that as a much better use of my time than what we're doing here. I'd still rather be your friend than your enemy.﻿

    Thank you, communityband1. I really appreciate it, but there are some things I think John doesn't need to hear me say, and I don't want him to know, either, seeing as it draws along the lines of stuff he's already picked fun at in this very discussion. I'm not embarrassed by anything, and I certainly don't take his criticisms of Lindsey being a major motivation for me with much else than a grain of salt, but I get very exhausted with his tireless belittling of her, the good she's doing, and the inspiration she gave plenty of people. I'm also still struggling to understand how he could say he was a fan of hers, believed everything I said, I think even mentioned a similar dream to meet in her person and thank her, but, because of this one thing, we're all supposed to suddenly pick his side of this, abandoning all the things she's done and the gratitude we've had for those things. Plus, I don't think this Lindsey's comments should be filled with my problems, unlike some people... John.﻿

    Attempted_Logic: As I mentioned in the past, if you bring something up, expect nothing less than for it to be used, because it becomes public knowledge. Also, I'm not going to change my opinions of Lindsey, because you're making far more out of your expectations than anything even remotely close to the truth. I sympathize with your issue, but I will not agree with your views on Lindsey, because they simply aren't the case, none of them. She's no hero. She's concerned with money over anything else you're saying to her at meet-and-greets, only nodding her head with some fake smile on her face, half-listening to you, likely watching the clock, and I will keep saying your spending money on a hug, which is ridiculous. I have no issues with hugging, but I have an issue with people spending over two hundred dollars for it, which removes it's meaning entirely. If you had the ability to hug your friends, I doubt you would be giving them two hundred dollars every time... How are you not getting this notion? 

    I'm not breaking it down like that, because not everyone is getting the same thing, unless you upgrade your tickets, which is limited. At it's most basic, you're seeing her concert, which, for the amount you're paying, is equivalent to its price, if it weren't generic music being played, but is, making it worth less than it should cost. The album is simply worthless, given you'll only listen to it around the holidays, because you're highly unlikely still playing Christmas music past December, and it's rehashed music... It's not important if it's of your own volition. If it never existed, you wouldn't have wasted your money on it in the first place...

    I'll also address the fact, if only because it's horse, you're taking advice from a person who's completely wrong about Lindsey reading comments, and replying to them, as she hasn't left a comment on one of her videos in several months... You proved she's commenting on other videos, which I can't deny, being I found them, even though it's exceptionally rare, but she definitely isn't commenting on her own content, and she's very unlikely reading anything commented on her videos, too, the same as liking comments. 

    You also shouldn't be taking any advice from communityband1 on something like you have, given he likely hasn't the foggiest clue of the problem, and he's no sympathetic/emotional person, either... Do focus your attention on people with a better understanding of things such as those. I'd offer myself, given I have prior experience on matters similar to yours, but your views on Lindsey would prevent me from giving you much advice. As far as my own change in opinions of Lindsey, as I said, but few seem to realize, I changed from being a fan, and lost the sheepish mentality, because I opened my eyes, spotting the many obvious cracks, blocked by blind hope I'm sorry to say I believed in at some time. If I could spot them, I don't see it being an impossibility for others, too. I'm not trying to be a hero, contrary to your belief, not trying to ruin Lindsey's reputation, contrary to communityband1's belief. I'm pointing out the things too many people are far too wrapped up in the Stirlingite mentality to notice.﻿

    communityband1: The takeaway message from the unnecessarily long portion of an article you provided seems to support my theory... It's not actually valuable, but, because it's Lindsey-related, people will buy it, because it's perceived value, influenced by sentimental value in this case, overshadows the actual value... 

    As I said, there's no sentimental impact on getting a new car, and Lindsey's fans are perceiving the value based on sentimentality. So, it's decidedly different... They are getting ripped off... 

    How nice of you to say... Also, I find it difficult to put in effort trying to convince the unmoved person that is you... I've given plenty of sufficient evidence to you, to which you so quickly dispel it as insufficient, and let's face facts. If I didn't say another word to you, you would still keep commenting on my comments. So, even though I've all but established you're impossible, because you'd never shut up, I'm trying to do the absolute impossible, praying one day you'll open your eyes... So, am I disinterested? As far as you're concerned, yes, extremely disinterested, and yes, your bullheadedness is frustrating, making this conversation a nightmare... 

    Did you not read the entire thing I said, outlining sheep logic... You have more than adequately given Lindsey the benefit of the doubt, especially with her priorities... 

    Where are you pulling that number from? 

    Almost every single person on the planet has full knowledge of the effects of cigarettes, so there goes that out the window... I'm not suggesting we stop advertising, merely stop tricking people into buying things we would never touch if not for some celebrity making it seem worth while. It's underhanded... 

    There are 4 people involved in this mess, myself, you, the person I will only address exists in here for the sake of this example, and the on and off one with no purpose here anymore... Do you think, out of these people, anyone wants to read articles down to the letter? Also, if you sound like the article, what give you the impression it's going to be accepted by me?

    You operate entirely by perceived value, John. If you didn't, you would die. And your statement shows you misunderstood. "Actual value" and "actually valuable" are not the same thing. "Actual value" is an economics term that describes a mathematical summation of factors including the cost of production, whereas "actually valuable" describes importance. If you feel "perceived value" is less important than "actual value," then try going without food or clothing, because neither of those are typically traded at actual value.

    You buy things because of the value you perceive they have to your life. Your declarations of the value of Lindsey's music are in fact examples of perceived value - you perceive the value is less than the market as a whole agrees. You're not calculating "actual value," as that would entail measuring things you have no information on, including production costs.

    Now a distinct but related concept here is market value. "The perceived value of a commodity or security is what someone thinks it should be worth. The price, or market value, is a reflection of what the majority of the market perceives to be the value of the product, and is what the commodity is actually worth at that specific point in time."

    Notice the phrase "actually worth." When someone purchases Lindsey's album, he makes an equal trade, because he now owns a commodity that fetches this price on the market. This price is what the album is actually worth.

    "As I said, there's no sentimental impact on getting a new car..."

    That sentence is awkward. But regardless, it's a ridiculous assertion. Everybody knows that car "dealers" negotiate prices. It's in their job title... Every day, people explain to dealers that they aren't willing to pay the asking price, and every day, car dealers lower the price. And people absolutely select cars for personal reasons. Does spending $150,000 on a vehicle make practical sense? Car prices and sales are hugely impacted by perceived value.

    "I've given plenty of sufficient evidence to you..."

    I'm considering a new strategy of displaying this "evidence" to people. You've relied a great deal on hit and runs, where you state something as if it's proof, I counter in detail, and then you abandon it for a while. I'm going to show your arguments side by side with mine so people can decide exactly what your evidence is worth. Each time you repeat a claim, I'll share a link to a full version of that discussion with your logic side-by-side with mine (and whoever else contributes). Responding to you will simply be a matter of sharing a link to the relevant discussion where we went into as much depth as you could muster. And I'll update it. If you produce actual new ideas, I'll place them inline so they can clearly be matched up in a readable fashion. You've gotten away with far too much because it's difficult for people to understand a discussion when you fail to quote what you respond to. And each time I paste a link, I'll include a short explanation for people something like this: "Who is John Avery? John Avery has attacked Lindsey Stirling non-stop for months for personal reasons, repeating the same accusations over and over. Many people have wasted hours responding to his repeated arguments such as this one, so to save people time, I've combined a full discussion of this topic here, along with links to John's other comments against Lindsey.

    "praying one day you'll open your eyes..."

    Only a fool would follow someone into a state of anger and resentment, particularly when being benefited by the very same actions that lead to that anger and resentment.

    "Did you not read the entire thing I said, outlining sheep logic... You have more than adequately given Lindsey the benefit of the doubt..."

    I asked you to name something specific. Name one argument where I have not given any reason or data to support my position. If you're going to state my claims are mindless, you really need to show I've never put thought behind them and simply repeated the words of others. To be honest, I think you've lost track of what the term "sheep" means. I think you're suggesting it means "benefit of the doubt." Not in English. Rational deduction will tell us we should give Lindsey the benefit of the doubt that she cares about things more than money and fame, because every human we've ever encountered cares about some things more than money and fame. But I've gone beyond this. I've listed numerous ways that Lindsey throws away both money and fame.

    "Where are you pulling that number from?"

    That was the point. I pulled it out of thin air to demonstrate the silliness of complaining about the introduction of new ideas at any arbitrary point in a discussion.

    "Almost every single person on the planet has full knowledge of the effects of cigarettes..."

    Incorrect. "Among the whole sample population, 34% wrongly considered that a daily consumption of up to 10 cigarettes was not associated with any risk of lung cancer..."

    And furthermore: "Cigarette consumption can be seen as imposing externalities through greater health care system costs based on increased use due to smoking, the effects of second hand smoke, and lost worker productivity."

    Also, while this may be how we measure the economic cost, there is also the moral problem with selling things to people that we know hurt them and cause them to become addicted. Printers are neither addictive nor cancer-causing, and as such, they don't require moral conflict to create, sell, or advertise.

    "I'm not suggesting we stop advertising, merely stop tricking people into buying things we would never touch if not for some celebrity making it seem worth while."

    Stop, I'm trying to get this into your head. You must grasp this concept. Why do people purchase music? Why do people purchase a Sprocket? Why do people purchase a game? To make themselves happy. Think about that statement. The reason they purchase these things is to make themselves happy. That is the goal. And because that's the goal, that is the only legitimate way to measure success. It has absolutely nothing to do with the "actual value" of a product. If it makes them happy, then by definition, it is a good buy. 

    You're throwing away something incredibly important, John. Happiness is a good goal. In life, there aren't many things better than happiness. It is absolutely more precious than money. And it's completely personal. What makes you happy won't make other people happy. We absolutely have to let people decide what things will make them happy, because only they can do it. If spending $12 on an album creates more happiness for someone than the same $12 spent elsewhere does, then it is right. And you're the only person in the entire world who can know where your $12 will bring you the most happiness.

    Even in your dream scenario where someone buys a printer to make a celebrity happy (don't get me started), the measure of success is whether or not the person is happy about having done something he feels is nice. 

    Stop pretending to yourself that so many things are more valuable than happiness. I think you could use a little more, for goodness sake! And stop trying to change people's minds about what should make them happy. Your objective here is to remove a source of happiness from people's lives because you believe that happiness is unjustified. ... What???

    Now just a sec - what I'm about to say does not apply to my opinion of Lindsey - but I want you to think about something I read back when researching CWS. A psychologist raised the point that as long as a child praises the positive behaviors of a celebrity, it really doesn't matter if the celebrity matches the expectations. In other words, the important thing is for children to value and model actions that are good, not people. And really, this is true beyond celebrities. There are no perfect people. But we can look at the good things other people do, praise them, and try to model those things in our lives. If someone looks at a celebrity and sees great kindness, that's good. It won't actually matter if they are right or wrong, because the thing they praise is the kindness.

    "Also, if you sound like the article, what give you the impression it's going to be accepted by me?"

    I prefer to give you the chance. I'm not stating controversial economic theories. These ideas come from Adam Smith, the father of modern economics.﻿

    communityband1: It's like you're trying to make this more complicated than it actually is... So, let's outline this, to try simplify it, something you seem incapable of, for some reason... 

    Lindsey's album: 
    Actual Value: Sticker price, established through mathematics, to insure the album makes a profit more than it's production cost. 
    Actually Valuable (The useless thing you brought up to complicate this topic): Food, water, essentials for the basic needs of people to survive, i.e. nothing related to Lindsey's album, because you can live without it... So, as I said, irrelevant... 
    Perceived Value: The value of something to the consumer, for anything it can provide, an example, emotional stimulus. 

    So, given the album is not actually valuable, and it's actual value is its sticker price, and fans aren't taking into account its sticker price, because their perceived value of it clouds their better judgment to see it's not really worth as much as it is, because it's generic garbage, not worth the amount it costs, it's a ripoff. Why is it I can outline this so simply, but you need half a page, dragging pointless things into the topic? 

    I'm not even going to bother with the car analogy, because you have completely turned a simple example into something far past its intended point...  

    If you do, I'll simply stop replying to you, only leave my singular comment and ignore you, because cluttering up comments is not helping anything... You're under this illusion I abandon points you counter, which is total nonsense, and you're subject to the same accusation. If anything, these discussions are nothing but repeating topics, which you feel the need to drag out, forcing me to follow you down this rabbit hole of irrelevant topics, which have nothing to do with my original statements, because you like to complicate things and not let them go, even if you're wrong, which you have been, many times... 

    "Only a fool would follow someone into a state of anger and resentment, particularly when being benefited by the very same actions that lead to that anger and resentment." 

    So, basically, you're calling anyone who agrees with me, and there's one in this comment chain, a fool? Nice job... Didn't realize you were the voice of reason...

    Yes, and there's you're perfect example of sheep logic. When you've gone beyond to list things to dispel my claims, you've used nothing but benefit of the doubt... Of course, you've used factual information on the occasion, but you've used plenty of sheep logic, too... 

    I can't believe this debate on cigarettes (an example of your dragged in topics, making the discussion more complicated and irrelevant) is still happening... You're comparing apples to oranges... The bottom line is, if you're using a celebrity to get people to buy something they don't need, and wouldn't buy had the celebrity not advertised it, but will because of the celebrity, which, even if you're too bullheaded to concede to, they exist, which I showed you, but you still couldn't admit you were wrong (like always) it's underhanded tactics. You are wrong. Drop it. There's the reason these never stop. You can't suck up some of your pride, and let something go... 

    I'm removing happiness... You must be a heavy believer in ignorance is bliss... If someone is "unhappy" with the truth, it doesn't change the fact it's the truth... If I point out an album is a ripoff, a. how sad is your life you can't handle that as a fact, and b. you should question some of your choices in life if you were too belligerent to consider it was in the first place... 

    You presented one of the most idiotic things I think you've said in the several months you've gone on... It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, because they're praising kindness? No, by that definition, they're praising fake kindness, because doing something wrong isn't kind, is it? If you lie to your fans, it isn't kind, is it? If you teach people to be sellouts, it isn't kind, is it? If they repeat those things, spread those ideas, it isn't kind, is it? You say I'm the one with the faulty logic, yet you seem to be doing a great job... 

    I have an idea, from this point out, if you attempt to digress, if you attempt to create clutter, I will ignore the statement you made entirely, and keep this straight, because you are wasting my time... I'll point out one thing irrelevant to this I feel like you should hear. You claim about wanting to help, being a friend more than an enemy. You couldn't be doing a more pathetic job, because all you are is a thorn jammed in my side...﻿

    Honestly, communityband1, it's not weird to me, because I speak to several people daily, much younger than me, on a popular ios/Android game I've become fairly well-known, even have two of my animations posted by a good deal of people on YouTube. So, it's pretty much the same thing in reverse, meaning I'd be the younger one. I'm simply not the kind of person to spread my problems onto people. If anything, I'm usually the listener. It's a bit sad, though, realizing a 7-year-old is more compromising than John. I'm very grateful, and I wish you the best of luck with this endeavor. I think I can tell when I can't do anything, and my best effort isn't enough to fix something of this magnitude. It was nice speaking to you ^^

    If you're still around,  CaptHayfever, it was nice speaking to you again, too ^^ 

    John, I'm going to keep this as laconic as possible, because I would expect nothing less than a rude reply for any niceness or "sheepishness" I'd show. I'm not the best judge of character, by far. If anything, I always lean more on the side of giving someone the benefit of the doubt. However, I think I would be able to tell if Lindsey was a genuine sweetheart, if I'm able to pull myself together enough to meet her in person. I hope this problem of yours gets resolved, and you can move past the problems you have with Lindsey, or, at the very least, you stop putting fans down in the comments. The one thing I will point out to you is the overall flaw in your commenting. If you're so convinced Lindsey's fans are sheep, and she's not reading anything, never mind the fact she's never going to respond to someone who's spent his time belittling her for the most benign reasons, like her hair, which, for the record, I got used to, because, even if I loved her red hair, she's still beautiful, there's literally no point to you pointing out the "cracks in the paint," seeing as nobody is going to listen or agree with you. If you think those thumbs up are your validation, like I remember communityband1 saying, it's more than likely people searching for something negative, and, because you're the only one so flagrantly, consistently negative, they know exactly who to go to for their silent output of negativity, most of it completely unjustified. I've seen people dislike videos before even being able to watch them to completion... What is that if not for simply being spiteful? Anyway, I'm rambling. I still think there's some hope for you, if you try hard enough too see the amazing things Lindsey's done and is still doing every single chance she gets the opportunity. It's like I said, it's mindset, not Lindsey ^^﻿

I've mentioned this in the past. The fact she dyed her hair isn't the issue, even if it's duller and more boring, it's the fact she did it for a completely sheepish reason... As to your theory of mindset, if she didn't make it so incredibly transparent she's greedy and fame obsessed, I'd consider it possible. Also, I highly doubt every single person is liking my comments for nothing else than for the sake it's negative. I'm clearly not convincing you otherwise, but I have a pinch of respect for you for the sake you're not continuing past your reply, even if your thoughts on Lindsey are still on the sheepish side...

    The reason I'm going into detail is because you still misunderstand the terminology and the implications.

    "Actual Value: Sticker price, established through mathematics, to insure the album makes a profit more than it's production cost."

    No. The sticker price and the "actual value" are very different. The sticker price is the current "market value" and represents what the market currently agrees the product is worth. It can change over time with factors such as value perception and supply and demand. "Actual value" is static and represents the theoretical price we would arrive at if we add up all of the production costs, marketing costs, etc. required to sell a product for profit if there were no expectations on either the part of the buyer or the seller. That's why this condition rarely exists. Sellers virtually always hope to make more money than the minimum sustainable profit. Skating along the threshold of profitability would be dangerous in the business world, because you will always have times when things don't go as well, and coming out on top requires that your average performance be positive. Likewise, customer perception of value drives market value (prices) above or below actual value.

    "Actually Valuable (The useless thing you brought up to complicate this topic): Food, water, essentials for the basic needs of people to survive, i.e. nothing related to Lindsey's album, because you can live without it... So, as I said, irrelevant... "

    I didn't introduce this. You used the phrase to distinguish between "actual value" and "perceived value." Furthermore, the words "valuable" and "necessity" are in no way synonymous. Gold is valuable because it is expensive. Friendships are valuable because they're important to us. An album we like may be more valuable to us than the $12 we exchange for it. If we perceive something is valuable to us, then it is valuable to us. 

    "Perceived Value: The value of something to the consumer, for anything it can provide, an example, emotional stimulus."

    Correct.

    "So, given the album is not actually valuable"

    Incorrect. If something is perceived to be valuable, it is valuable, by definition. You believe you're talking about "actual value" when you say this, but you're not. In fact, Lindsey's Brave Enough album and her Christmas album likely have the highest actual value among her four albums. The production costs involved with working with different artists and producers for Brave Enough were almost certainly higher than with Shatter Me. Lindsey also began development of over 60 songs for Brave Enough, implying a lot of time went into the creation process that never made it into the album. For the Christmas album, Lindsey hired an orchestra (and I think other ensembles as well). This would mean she also had to arrange a printed score with parts, which I know from personal experience is a huge undertaking. Actually, as good as sample libraries have become, Lindsey certainly had the option of saving a great deal of money on this. Do you know what I mean by sample libraries?

    As I stated before, your valuation of Lindsey's album is the value you perceive it has. It is not the actual value. And it isn't the market value that someone can buy, resell or return the album for.

    "You're under this illusion I abandon points you counter, which is total nonsense, and you're subject to the same accusation."

    I asked you to name any argument you have against Lindsey which I have not addressed. You declined.

    "...which have nothing to do with my original statements..."

    Topics like this have everything to do with your comments, because they likely show why you do not understand Lindsey. If you and Lindsey don't see eye to eye on economics and business, there's no reason you should expect her to believe she is doing something wrong. This is the most important argument.

    "I can't believe this debate on cigarettes (an example of your dragged in topics, making the discussion more complicated and irrelevant) is still happening... You're comparing apples to oranges..."

    That is my point. Printers are apples and cigarettes are oranges. One hurts people, the other does not. It doesn't take immoral ambition to work for HP or advertise a printer.

    "...using a celebrity to get people to buy something they don't need..."

    I do not accept your authority to dictate what I need. I do not accept your authority to define what should be important to me. I do not want to live in a world where choice is restricted from me because someone believes I'm not intelligent enough to make up my own mind. Children are the responsibility of their parents. Adults deserve every opportunity to make up their own minds.

    "...they exist, which I showed you..."

    Here it is again. At the time we discussed this topic, you abandoned your defense the first time I gave logic against it. Now you bring it back as if you carried it to victory. I'll share your logic against mine and let people judge. However, as I've already explained, it is not your place to say which reasons are valid for anyone else.

    "If I point out an album is a ripoff, a. how sad is your life you can't handle that as a fact, and b. you should question some of your choices in life if you were too belligerent to consider it was in the first place..."

    First of all, people pay me for my musical expertise. I don't believe you're paid for yours, and I evaluate these albums differently. Second, CaptHayfever linked to a very relevant article about your belief that you are right about the value of art while the prevailing consensus is wrong. Third, you have never purchased an album for its "actual value." You purchase music because you believe you will enjoy it. Everyone else does the same.

    "I'm removing happiness..."

    You're trying to. I realized after I wrote it that I could rephrase your objections:

    "No people, stop! Stop!!! The album is not worth $12 of happiness, it's only $8 of happiness! Don't waste $4 on happiness you don't get!"

    "I'm miserable because I think Lindsey has changed - it's hurting me. Agree with me so you can be less happy, too! Whatever you do, don't be happy for the wrong reasons! And don't be nice to people for the wrong reasons!"

    "You presented one of the most idiotic things I think you've said in the several months you've gone on... It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, because they're praising kindness? No, by that definition, they're praising fake kindness, because doing something wrong isn't kind, is it?"

    I'm sorry that you don't understand the expert's point. It should not seem like a revelation. We are exposed to people daily who do things we accept as kind despite knowing next to nothing about them. We are in no way hurt when we go to a grocery store, encounter a store clerk who is polite to us, and come away thinking that person is nice. We're not injured because we don't know this person secretly goes home and forces his cat to eat dog food. We're not injured if this person only was polite because his manager just told him to up his game. We only saw a behavior that we interpreted as kind and became a little more likely to share kindness with others as a result.

    "You claim about wanting to help, being a friend more than an enemy."

    No, I said I would rather be your friend than your enemy. But as long as you attack anyone, I will oppose you.﻿

    communityband1: An interesting thing, I pointed out something and peculiarly it happened. You were present in the place it happened, but you are unlikely to claim it was the direct cause of this, although one can't deny the odd coincidence... Of course, there are plenty of explanations, but it does seem strange... "Lindsey never uses the account's specific like button, never comments on her channel." I've called attention to this multiple times, specifically here... Suddenly, she does, not on this account, but close enough... You aren't going to pick the side of rationality, but, if there's one thing you have to acknowledge, it's an extremely coincidental event, given she hasn't used the option in months... Yes, there's also the chance she's drumming up fans to support her latest endeavor, too, but it's interesting either way... 

    Did you anticipate, with all your "knowledge," I would say something on her newer video, waiting to jump at the chance to open your mouth? Do you think I don't know you well enough by now? I guess you're wrong, being, if I was really so desperate for the attention of others, I would've put up something on there, but why? I don't see the point, given my only "concern" was the thing I listed above, nothing worth the attention of anyone else, as I don't think anyone else, minus you, Attempted_Logic, CaptHayfever, and possibly Lindsey, as I'm beginning to question, are really aware of my statement she never comments or publicly likes anything with her icon. Are you still on the video, refreshing the page, waiting for the comment, as I write this one? As if you're not easily predictable enough... You're not as good at predicting behavior, as you assume, I suppose...﻿

    Possible reason: Even Lindsey herself finds you so obnoxious that's she started responding to comments again just to spite you, just to make you wrong.
    Other possible reasons: Tons of far more realistic things.﻿

I still have yet to see another person display some of the disturbed things you've so poorly justified as research or learning... I notice you also failed to acknowledge the coincidence of the situation, or own up to the fact your judgement is inaccurate, as, if it was, I would have almost assuredly gone off to comment something on the new video. Also, let's not play dumb. As if you aren't monitoring new videos, waiting for me, so you can open your mouth... You've even mentioned you've studied comments I've put up in the past, which would be indicative you're watching. I've been going about this thing with you the wrong way. If one wishes to try reasoning with you the way I have, they wouldn't get too far, being I haven't. Perhaps, this is the best way to handle your belligerent temperament, unrelenting requests to have you answer something I would otherwise leave alone, and make similar claims as you, based on things you've said in the past, making them seem like more than they might be, but could be, so I'll assume they are, like you... You might find it's an annoying way of thinking, if your behavior is mirrored... It's sad when people I no longer communicate with directly are willing to acknowledge, with an asterisk of course, but still, Lindsey's oddly coincidental shift in YouTube communication...﻿

    "I still have yet to see another person display some of the disturbed things you've so poorly justified as research or learning..."

    Such as what... looking through Lindsey's videos for the past few months to see how long you've been at this, and reading what you've told other people on the same subject? People told me in our very first discussion that you'd been at this for a while, so yes, I looked to see what had been said. That's also how I noticed that you've been using three separate accounts, all with the name John Avery and just slightly different avatar colors.

    "I notice you also failed to acknowledge the coincidence of the situation..."

    I didn't fail to acknowledge it. I deliberately chose not to, because I wanted to highlight my question, since you generally avoid answering things like that (as you did here). The truth is I think your reasoning is off. You believe that Lindsey might be paying attention to your complaints, and yet just before this, she posted plenty of duplicate advertisements, which she would certainly know would set you off. I see no effort on her part to appease you. Furthermore, Lindsey recently said that she didn't have computer internet access in South America. So unless you believe she was keeping up with this discussion on a mobile device, which is pretty impractical, I think you're almost certainly wrong. She posts comments on Twitter. She posts comments on Facebook. And she has comments on LindseyTime, new and old. These three accounts share a largely common group of followers and are used for similar purposes. Your second idea seemed far more plausible, that she might intend to try to step up some community interaction to build excitement for DWTS. But we've also seen her comment on other people's channels before DWTS was announced. It may be that she's simply changing her strategy again after a period of time. Whatever the case is, if you believe that she is bothered by what you say, I'm sorry, but I think you're kidding yourself. There is no pressure on her for this because nobody else is complaining. And I don't believe after reading your comments that she would ever try to lead you on, because I don't believe she would think it's healthy for you to invest in her. If she is aware of you, I think she would probably hope you move on and forget her. And I do not see the coincidence that you do. You've been complaining about her lack of YouTube comments for months. If you keep that up continuously as you have, then if she ever happens to come back on, you could claim it matches up with the timing of something you've said. That's not terribly rational. All in all, DWTS seems like a stronger and more meaningful coincidence than John Avery, so if you have to pinpoint something, I guess that would be my guess.

    "Also, let's not play dumb. As if you aren't monitoring new videos, waiting for me, so you can open your mouth..."

    No, you're quite wrong. I already told you I have a different strategy in mind going forward.﻿

    communityband1: You're very unaware of how the system functions, and the steps you're sometimes required to take to get some things to stay, aren't you? I'm not denying the fact the avatar colors are changing on the occasion, and I'll even point out you can see variations of color on this very comment chain. Yet, you aren't quite aware of what's actually going on, I'm afraid. Let's be honest. If I was trying to hide accounts, do you believe I would be so dimwitted as to not change the colors, or use them in the same comment chain? Do try give me some credit... I'll also point out YouTube has a system in place where you can't like your own comments with created accounts of the same address, a fail safe to prevent multiple likes/dislikes on videos. It does raise the question. How did you do it? Huh, not important... What is important is your behavior goes far beyond merely checking videos for me, which only indicates you have no life, if you're going through videos to look for me and read them... I'd point them out, but you would simply spew out some nonsense I've expended my energy of being to listen to you twist in your favor... It's merely the fact you are, and there's nothing you're saying or doing lately to prove me wrong, only strengthen it, and telling you about them wouldn't change your actions, either... I find some irony in the fact you spend more time on me, on this, than your own channel. Don't I feel lucky? The YouTube failure acknowledges my existence more than his subscribers... I'm touched... 

    Did I ignore it? No, I simply know you well enough to know you'd spill out the same garbage you always do, if I was to have given you an answer. I said if it was irrelevant, it wasn't going to be acknowledged. I fully expect to continue this method. After all, I answer you as a courtesy, not because I owe you one... I could easily ignore you, and my original comment wouldn't change, and, although some people might acknowledge you in the beginning, they quickly stop caring about your babbling, as I've noticed as the continuation of these progresses. If it wasn't for your number one fan, you would have as many likes on your comments as mine. It's adorable, you showing support of each other, though... Regardless, if you think the reason of probability is your best logic, i.e. if I say it enough it's likely to happen, you're on some loose ground there... There have existed many of these coincidences as of recently, and I can't imagine they're so easily put off as "I said them so many times the probability of them happening, being acknowledged was made certain." It seems like your running out of ideas... It must be difficult to have to acknowledge something without your usual method of burying it under so much nonsense I lose interest in bringing it up another time... You've done this many times, branching off. "I've always acknowledged every one of your points." No, you really haven't... As it were, you've skipped many of them, but, as I said, I used to get so flooded by your digression, I felt like it wasn't a good idea to add anything else, being, unlike you, I enjoy things being orderly, concise, not unnecessarily long. I remember saying this to you in the very beginning, and you forced me to write as long as you, because you put in so much irrelevant garbage I had to explain, in detail... Of course, if we're to assume my other supposition is correct, and she is drumming up fans, there's some of the good old-fashioned Lindsey using her fans, pretending to communicate for something other than her selfishness... Transparent...

    Yes, my word versus yours... It's pretty much how these conversations boil down... Of course, you tipped your hand on that strategy long ago, and you never abandoned it...  Do keep trying to lie to me. It's funny...﻿

    --Actually, it would be smarter to not change the colors, as it would mask the fact that the accounts were different.

    "I'll also point out YouTube has a system in place where you can't like your own comments with created accounts of the same address,"
    --Actually, you can like your own comments with the same account. And putting multiple accounts on the same address, that would be dimwitted.

    John, why did you just create an argument with Megan? How does that serve you?

    Well, I was sort of hoping that if you got the last word in on me and believed you got away with something, you might be in a place to move on.

    John, you're being dishonest about your profiles. You've either created separate accounts, or you've created multiple channels with the same name under a single account. You have three separate channel IDs that appear in the URL when we mouse-over your profile name. You've created at least three different channels to attack Lindsey. And contrary to what you say, each channel allows you to Like the posts of the other two, because Likes are tied to a channel, not a user ID.

    The only obstacle we've faced with posting comments is a word filter.

    "if you're going through videos to look for me and read them..."

    When people tell me you've been at this for a long time and describe you as they did, I'm going to see what you've said before I engage you further. Keep in mind you also said some really strange things to me in that first thread. Spending a few minutes to try to understand you is better than flying blind. Likewise, I think it was smart of you to check out my channel and my videos to try to learn some things about me. I have no reason to believe you've spent less time learning about me than I have you. If we make things public, we invite people to see them.

    "The YouTube failure acknowledges my existence more than his subscribers... I'm touched..."

    That's false. I've already explained to you that I don't intend for my YouTube account to be a destination for people. There are other YouTubers who manually create videos to teach people songs, one song and one instrument at a time. I don't want to get into that business, because it's inefficient and creates potential copyright issues. So I provide my users software that automatically arranges music for them and whatever instruments they play. You see a handful of videos on my channel. What I'm really giving my users is access to hundreds of thousands of songs arranged for whatever instrument they play and whatever difficulty they choose. They also get practice tools that let them set the tempo to whatever they like and set up practice loops. And I put a lot of time into it. It's the only resource like it in the world. So no, I don't feel like I'm abandoning anyone.

    By the way, John, do you remember the message in Lindsey's video, "The Arena?" Have you actually stepped into the YouTube video arena yet?

    "After all, I answer you as a courtesy, not because I owe you one..."

    How do you define courtesy?

    "There have existed many of these coincidences as of recently, and I can't imagine they're so easily put off as 'I said them so many times the probability of them happening, being acknowledged was made certain.'"

    Being acknowledged was made certain? No, I'm not saying we've been acknowledged. I'm saying that if you constantly say the same things, and Lindsey happens to do something that in some way relates to what you've said, then of course the timing will line up. But let's not kid ourselves. Lindsey didn't immediately favorite any comments after we discussed that here. She could have done so on this video. Furthermore, it's not as if she hasn't used the special Like button for a long time. She's used it in the past several months. Before that, the vast majority of her videos were live streams, and in those she talks directly to her fans.

    Remember that I also noted that Lindsey's lack of computer internet access would have made it difficult to discover this thread.

    "As it were, you've skipped many of them..."

    Every time you say this, I ask you to be specific. What are these points you've raised that I've never addressed?

    "Of course, if we're to assume my other supposition is correct, and she is drumming up fans..."

    I said I thought it was a more plausible suggestion, but I doubt very much it was correct. A clever person will think about other factors... for example:

    1. Do Lindsey's fans on her LindseyTime channel who are watching and commenting on a video about her appearance on DWTS actually need "drumming up" to support her? It's hard to see how she moves the needle with this.

    2. Considering she posted the same video to Facebook, where it was seen by far more people and shared with many more people who don't know her as well, wouldn't it make more sense to try the tactic there? Note that I'm not saying she won't or shouldn't do this. But if her motivation was to flatter only for selfish gain, I think she would have pursued more fruitful strategies.

    I think the best explanation for responding to people on LindseyTime is that she wants to express some appreciation.﻿

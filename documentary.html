Are you kidding me... This hasn't even broken 100,000 views, and it's on trending... Plus, it's less than 3 minutes long and a premiere of a movie that's almost a month old... Seriously, she could put up a five second video of her sneezing, and YouTube would put it on trending... Nice job, spitting in the face of actual YouTube stars, who actually put in some effort... Pathetic...﻿

Ah, yes, I forgot, having everyone else do the work for her while she did her usual routine involved so much effort on her part... I guess we're still not acknowledging the movie is a month old, so this video is way past due, and it shouldn't be on trending, too... Also, way to discredit every single YouTube star, because they totally don't put in any effort past filming and editing... What exactly is she doing here, putting up a video someone else put together. Yeah... so much effort... I'm still waiting for that video of her sneezing...﻿

Lindsey actually films and edits most of her videos (she even directed Hold My Heart - a more recent music video). She puts in an incredible amount of work and love into her videos. No, she didn't edit the movie, but she does edit the videos she puts up on this channel. She's not just a celebrity who sits around and gets mani/pedis all the time :I﻿

Duskflower Actually, she did edit quite a bit of the movie. That's why she had to learn the new editing application that she was talking about while she was talking, on stage. She's even said that in one of her previous videos. :) She, indeed, puts a ton of work and love in to everything she puts out for her fans.﻿

This video had zero effort on her part, and, like everything else she's done lately, it had to have a product slipped in there, because it's not completely obvious she put it up for HP... I was actually waiting for Hold My Heart to start playing, being it's become her #1 HP sellout song... Of course, everyone else includes the product of the people sponsoring them in the video randomly, right... Ah, the transparency and corporate sucking up is real...﻿

YouTube's video ranking is determined algorithmically, as opposed to employees picking and choosing content. This is how YouTube describes the algorithm:

"“Trending considers view count — especially the rate of growth in views — and where views are coming from, but many other signals also contribute to determining what's trending. This means that the video with the highest view count on a given day may not be #1 on Trending, and videos with more views may be shown below videos with fewer views.

We treat all channels equally and do not favor any specific creators. We do not accept payment for placement on Trending. We don’t talk about the exact details of the algorithm to prevent abuse of our systems."

It would obviously be strange for YouTube to base the algorithm predominantly on views, since the purpose of the algorithm is to help videos get views. In addition to click-through rate, I also suspect it weighs in Likes per View, and this might give us a clue why Lindsey's videos initially score highly. Early on, this video had more than 1 like for every 10 views, which is high.

YouTube content creators have a vested interest in the success of YouTube Red. Ad revenue is proving less and less dependable, with the host of ad blockers gaining ground and more recently with some advertisers pulling away from YouTube. YouTube Red is praised by content creators who don't create Red content because it gives them a more reliable, stable source of income. Because of this, promotion of this documentary is probably something most content creators will appreciate because of its ability to sell YouTube Red subscriptions that support them financially. I'm personally glad that Google is helping to find ways to support the production of web content, both here on YouTube and with upcoming products built for addressing ad blockers. These things can help me produce content.

John, you said, "...do the work for her while she did her usual routine." I assume this is why people got the impression you must be talking about her performance routine and the film itself. I'm not sure what you mean is "usual" about Lindsey's "routine" for arranging a movie premiere, since it's not something she does very often. In any case, I assume she also edited this video. It's not the most complicated thing she's done, obviously, but it's got more work in it than some other things currently trending above it.﻿

Ah, there he is...

"We treat all channels equally and do not favor any specific creators. We do not accept payment for placement on Trending. We don’t talk about the exact details of the algorithm to prevent abuse of our systems." 

Yeah, in other words, "We actually don't tell you how it's done, because we here at YouTube know that's a total load of nonsense, and bias is our #1 priority, as is evidenced by the fact very familiar faces wind up on our trending page, constantly..." 

This video hit trending by the time I viewed it (5 hours past its upload) and it hadn't even hit 75,000 views, it's like ratio nothing close to astonishing or decent. What mysterious algorithm could've established this, a premiere video, of movie that was almost a month ago, deserved to be on trending? Ah, yes, it's because it's Lindsey Stirling, the person who gets on the trending page nearly every single time she uploads, no matter what it is, within less than 2 hours most of the time, likely this time, too. As if other YouTube stars don't hit higher numbers than her, every single day, many never making it to trending. Of course, they don't suck up like she does... As I said, she could put a video of her sneezing, and it would be on trending in no time. Yeah, my left foot they aren't bias, and my right one she isn't lazy...

Plus, once again, there's the unnecessary product thrown in there, because, like I said, everyone focuses so heavily on a product, HP Sprocket (her #1 sellout sponsored product 0:47) when the video is supposed to be about a premiere night of a movie... Did I mention it's in the description, too, very easily noticeable, not under "show more?" I probably did, but, again, some coincidence... I'd be amazed if she even uploaded this video herself, never mind edited it, because she probably has people doing that for her, and she maybe touches this account once in a blue moon... Also, again, way to discredit other people on trending... How nice of you...﻿

Actually, John, YouTube proved beyond any doubt today that they do not pick favorites with the content. There is absolutely no way they would ever have chosen to put the anti-CNN Trump promotional video at #1 on trending today. Trump is against everything Google stands for.

>>This video hit trending by the time I viewed it (5 hours past its upload) and it hadn't even hit 75,000 views, it's like ratio nothing close to astonishing or decent.

You've never looked at this if you don't know that one in ten is extremely high. I can go down the list of the top trending right now and see these ratios for the top 10 trending: 1 in 45, 1 in 38, 1 in 33, 1 in 16, 1 in 19, 1 in 33, 1 in 38, 1 in 16, 1 in 68, 1 in 52. ALL of those are great compared to average. This video is currently better than all of them at 1 in 15. So as you can see, 1 in 10 is extremely high.

>>What mysterious algorithm could've established this, a premiere video, of movie that was almost a month ago, deserved to be on trending? 

I already told you one that would do it. An algorithm that weighs likes per view with a minimum view growth rate would certainly put this video in the top tier based on data I've analyzed. It's extremely unlikely that the algorithm would use AI to determine that this is a movie premiere for a movie that was released a month ago... do you have any experience writing machine learning algorithms? If you know how to build algorithms with NLP of that complexity, you should be making millions.

>>Ah, yes, it's because it's Lindsey Stirling...

YouTube explicitly explained the algorithm doesn't do that. Really, the only thing we need to make a reasonable guess at this is the tiniest bit of math.

>>As if other YouTube stars don't hit higher numbers than her, every single day, many never making it to trending.

YouTube content creators, like me, DO get boosted up by YouTube's search rankings. Making 30th place on the trending list isn't nearly as valuable a promotion of our content as the other things YouTube does to promote our content, such as the search rankings and the placement of links to our videos next to similar content. Making the top four or five videos on trending could provide a nice short term boost, but that's not where the bulk of our views are going to come from. It should be extremely clear from the view counts of videos on trending that making this list is no golden ticket. CTR is much higher on videos that match something a user is looking for and for videos users are directed to by someone else.

>>Did I mention it's in the description, too, very easily noticeable, not under "show more?"

Why would a product advertisement not be placed out in the open? Why would a company pay for that?﻿

John Avery Basically, if I am reading correct, it's about the rapidity of the view. How fast the views come in, not about the amount of views. Even still, Lindsey does a lot of her own work, and isn't someone who hires people to post a video for her. She's not that kind of person. Also, might I add, that of course she is advertising things that make them money. Otherwise Lindsey wouldn't be able to create content for her fans.﻿

Um-hm... so, based on everything given, I've read absolute nonsense. communityband1's algorithm: add in some opinion-based "facts" and some bias for good measure, subtract his credibility with some good old fashioned benefit of the doubt, multiply his lack of validity with some egotistical load, and divide my attention span for his comment, because it's so unnecessarily long... Seriously, say something worthy of reading... When you do, I'll address it, but, if all you're giving me is some more of your established algorithm horse, you're not worth the space on a comment... 

It's the same exact thing for everything else, benefit of the doubt. "She's not that kind of person." No, she's exactly that kind of person now, a sellout, lazy, and non creative. The first video you put up on this channel in a month, and it's some 3 minute long, way past relevant, HP suck up advertisement, lazy. Was Shadows sponsored? No. Did it do well? Yes. Can she create without sponsoring by this logic? Yes. Of course, he music wasn't generic garbage in the past, so she likely needs the atmosphere in her videos, not like it changes the fact they have zero meaning these days. Are other YouTube stars sponsored? Yes. Do they go out of their way to upload entire advertisements for a product, like Hold My Heart, TWICE? NO. Do they go on their Twitter, sucking up to some company constantly? NO. She "loves" HP more than her fans at this point... Of course, her fans don't pay her as much... It's amazing, how you can be completely morally twisted, and people still think you're perfect. It's equally as amazing, you're music becomes terrible, your content becomes awful, and you can upload anything at all, sometimes, like her, nothing for months, and your YouTube channel still gets subscribers, every day, by the thousands. The way the world works is fascinating, completely unfair, luck driven, like her career, and bizarre, but fascinating...﻿

2. Lindsey advertises because she needs the money to fuel her expensive ideas.
3. Lindsey continues to put feel-good, motivational, non-sponsores videos, which you neglect. E.g. recent beauty and the beast, acoustic pop covers, lost girls, and other smaller videos with other youtubers talking about insecurities and motivation (all recent).
Failing to address these points makes your argument a fallacy.﻿

How Lindsey's song "Hold My Heart" should've been written... 

Don't need much creativity,
to get someone to pay me. 
So, I'll sell out to HP. 
Money's my number one priority. 

It might be wrong, 
to be a corporate sheep.
But, when it comes to morality, I couldn't give a (bleep). 
I'd make my soul as black as tar. 
I don't really care about my fans,
I just want their credit cards.
(I just want their credit cards.) 

(insert generic, pop garbage violin here)

They'll never know what's amiss. 
I've got most of them convinced. 
Through the fake care that I've shown. 
I've made them think they're not alone.

communityband1 Well according to your arguments, the only way she can become nice again is if she stops advertising. In fact, by your reasoning someone who is a doctor will never be doing it because they want to help people because they get paid. Your logic is simple and ridiculous - you try to earn money, you're evil. Fyi, I met her in the brave enough tour in april, she was just as ecstatic as she was 4 years ago. Lindsey stirling has dreams that cost money. MONEY. Even 4 years ago she aimed to do this. I understand your viewpoint, but your argument makes selfishness unfalsifiable in this case.﻿

Tim Avery: I will assume you were referring to me, not communityband1, although I'm not quite understanding how you could've mixed me up with him... You, like everyone else, don't seem to see the actual issues and boil them down, simplify them, to make them sound ludicrous. You want things to be addressed? Fine. I'll waste my time... again... 

1. If you earn money, there's nothing wrong with you. Everyone needs money to survive. This is understood. It's the method by which it's ascertained where things become morally questionable. 
a. Lindsey sucks up to corporations, predominately HP, like a sheep. I can't tell you how many times she's tweeted with the hashtag HP. It's funny. She never used to mention them or their products, not until they began paying her. Now, she never shuts up about them... Yes, she was sponsored in the past, but she never sucked up to anyone so heavily prior, nor did she spend her focus shoving a useless product in your face in her videos and tweets. 
b. Lindsey crams her merchandise advertisements, new videos, and available tickets down the throats of her fans to the point she's begging them to watch or buy something. Does a doctor call you constantly for an appointment? No. So, why in the heck is she posting the same tweet, about the same product or video, back to back, within less than an hour? You can literally still read the first one... 

2. You can experiment with new sounds, but they don't have to be generic. 
a. Lindsey's music has turned into the same generic, pop garbage everyone else is using. There is zero uniqueness in her music. It's mainstream, and it's terrible. The next album she's going to make is a Christmas album, which couldn't be any more overused. It's like she's not even trying anymore, like her uploading pointless suck up videos, like this one...   

3. You can try something new with your videos, but they don't have to be 50 shades of what was the point of this video? 
a. Prism was garbage, randomly cutting from one "variation" of Lindsey to another. There was no plot, no meaning, and it was weird. 
b. Hold My Heart (the original) A gender bent Alice in Wonderland (so creative...) The dancing was messed up to the point parents had issues with their kids watching it, and it had no clear meaning. I think she might have gone temporarily nuts, thinking it was a good idea to lap dance next to a guy tied to a chair... Seriously, what the heck was she thinking? The other two were literally advertisements for HP, and no effort went into either of them. 
c. Love's Just A Feeling was all over the place, giving off the vibe "you get over people and move onto a new person in the blink of an eye, love is absolutely worthless." 500+ people agreed with this before it was removed... 
d. The Arena was the same thing, all over the place, filled with imagery far beyond anything Lindsey was known for, and the message was lost as consequence. I didn't think it, but I saw a lot demonic symbolism comments... 
e. Something Wild #Disneyselloutsong 
f. Lost Girls A sequel to Shatter Me (again... so creative...) Completely ruined the entire message of Shatter Me, should've never been mixed with her pinnacle of creativity.
g. RiMe #selloutforavideogamecompany 
h. In summation, she lost her ability to be creative, tap into human emotion or be related to, and sold out... Fantastic... 

4. It's your hair, not mine, but...
a. It still makes you look older. It's still boring as anything, and you don't look unique, only the same as everyone else. Plus, your reasoning behind it, because a company wanted you to, is pathetic... Seriously, she's beyond a puppet... 

5. You don't have to have some ulterior motive to connect to your fans. 
a. You can show gratitude without attaching a link to video or posting an advert within no time flat. 
b. You don't have to answer comments on YouTube for an hour, but one would be nice, being you used to... 
c. You can stop the fake "I care about my fans" gimmick, because you really don't, only their paychecks and for them to suck up to you... It's working nicely for you...
d. It's easy to smile if you're getting paid. (You met a plastered on smile with a fake "I'm so happy to see you" in April. Again, congratulations...) Even the most morally backwards people can smile if they have something to gain... It's all about keeping up with "I love my fans" horse... 

The conclusion: Lindsey has completely lost everything endearing about her, all of her uniqueness, both in appearance and music, is gone, she became a corporate suck up, is faker than imitation crab meat and, as far as I'm concerned, someone needs to take her album, rip it in front of her face, and say, "what the (bleep) happened to you?" I get the feeling it still wouldn't sink in, because, if she gets your money anyway, nothing you say will sink in, because she wouldn't feel anything, no sadness, feeling of her feelings being hurt, nothing. Seriously, I wonder if there's actually a heart in there, or if she sold that away, too...﻿

Tim Avery, I think you're probably right about John being depressed. There are many things I've established in my discussions with John. He's a young guy with limited life experience. He's had trouble in his personal relationships with people, and he turned to Lindsey as a sort of escape from this. Much of his confusion seems to stem from this, as he has a very unique understanding of Lindsey's proper role in the world, especially in regard to what she "owes" people who support her. He does not grasp the concept that Lindsey is a private business owner who provides products and services that people like and consume. In his mind, Lindsey must behave differently from other professionals because she is a musician. There is nothing unusual about how Lindsey operates her business. She builds up a following of people who like her content, and she regularly informs them about her new content so they can decide whether or not they want it. Most business professionals go no further than this and share nothing else - no personal information - no social interaction with their consumers, etc. And this is totally normal. In our society, this doesn't imply anything negative. Lindsey, on the other hand, DOES take extra steps and adds a great deal of personal touch to her business. We should be absolutely clear here. There would be nothing wrong with her actions if Lindsey never posted anything about her life or engaged with her fans. That would be close to the status quo. John complains about things Lindsey does and doesn't do which go far beyond society's expectations for her. John's expectations differ because he views Lindsey as someone who still owes her supporters a debt of gratitude that must be paid via a personal relationship with him and other fans. He doesn't understand that the only debt was essentially ours, and we paid it when we watched an ad or paid for a concert ticket so that we could enjoy the fruits of Lindsey's work. The balance is paid in full.

John is too stubborn to understand that businesses are nothing more than groups of people working together to create value for others, and advertising is nothing more than people sharing what they have to offer. He still sees the world in black and white - corporations bad, advertising bad. He can not grasp how much better off people are because of both of these things, and he thus sees any willingness to work with a company or participate in advertising as succumbing to evil and greed. And because he can't see these things from an adult perspective, he can't understand why Lindsey doesn't feel shame. He simply believes she's lying. In his mind, he has the only rational view of the world.

John is selective in picking examples of Lindsey's social interactions in order to make them fit his narrative. He ignores videos, posts and social media interactions which have nothing to do with selling services. Or he tries to argue that because Lindsey shares them within some arbitrary period of time from a product announcement, it's all part of a grand scheme. Regarding Lindsey's comment replies on YouTube, he ignores clear evidence this was a conscious decision that really can't be explained as a shift in her personality. Lindsey didn't gradually stop commenting on YouTube, as we might expect with someone losing interest. She stopped immediately, and simultaneously deleted all of her past comments. At about the same time, she began live streaming on YouTube where she occasionally responds to fan comments directly. Whether live streaming is intended as a substitute for written replies is unclear, but the very idea of a personality shift taking the form of such a purposeful action like this is comical. John also contradicts himself here, saying that Lindsey improves her reputation and makes money when she replies to comments, but she stopped replying on YouTube because she only cares about money.

John's resentment towards Lindsey fluctuates dramatically as he is put on the spot to defend his reasoning and is challenged to explain his contradictions. At one point he insinuated that Lindsey, via karma, might be responsible for the death of Gavi and her father. In desperation, he also begins to tell lies, claiming for example to be a business owner (or as he put it, a "self-business") who succeeded despite never telling anyone about his services.

I'm fairly certain that John has struggled in his personal relationships and uses the "likes" he gets on these videos to boost his self-confidence. He sees his "discovery" about Lindsey as something that makes him special and distinguishes him from Lindsey's "weak-minded" fans. It's unfortunate. He's an intelligent guy, but he seeks to make up for his insecurities in ways that hurt him and accomplish nothing.﻿

communityband1 In some ways I sympathise for him, judging by his previous posts he went through many personal struggles, and when Lindsey changed the way she operated, he subconsciously felt that the connection he built was threatened. He responded with anger and resentment, rather than making a small adaptation to her changes. It's clear his posts are a result of something personal because instead of just leaving the stirlingite commuinty he fights it, every day. Because of how angry he is, his perception of everything about Lindsey is morphed into something completely unrealistic, even disrespectful. It's sad, and I hope he could move on from it at some point.﻿

Lindsey, however will replace Mozart when future ppl think of violins. Her being "Brave Enough" to defy centuries old teachings when all the pros told her to drop her useless act, enabled her to discover a SUPREME art form hidden from the Masters for centuries!

As I said, wasting my time... could've slammed nonsense on the keyboard, would've gotten the same result. I was perfectly on the nose, for someone who can't see things accurately... The interesting part of one reply, though, does prove the hypocrisy, being communityband1, in good detail, using something HE established, with nothing more than conversations, could deduce my life, morals, etc, but, in the next breath, claims I'm doing something wrong, using a similar method to deduce Lindsey's change, and, based on HIS observations, could proclaim Lindsey as this and that, without knowing much else.There's no denying that, is there? I noticed some made up statements, accusations, thrown in for good measure. I'd say I've learned an interesting number of things about you, too (communityband1) although I'm not arrogant enough to dissect them in a mile-long post. Don't worry about my personal situations, though. It's like someone told me, on a different video, one who's surprising absent from this video, this conversation. "The way things operate in this world, John, are peculiar, the reason for the way things happen, often times with nothing but our own presumptions or something like religion to provide us with some form of an answer, closure. However, it's when we attempt to look deeper into the peculiarity of things, why things happen the way the do, we ourselves can become the peculiarity, as it drives us mad without us even knowing it, because we can't find the answer, and, in our madness, we wind up doing something without any reason other than the madness we created, madness which is only understood by ourselves, but no one else, and, if someone else attempts to understand it, the cycle is continued." I know exactly what he was referring to, his concern, but he never said it outright, likely to not seem combative. It's strange, how accurate it is, especially after seeing replies like these, the failure to see the cracks in the paint or even acknowledge them as a possibility, how it could, in fact, lead to something from the madness. Regardless, seeing the failure of acknowledgment, the idiocy, the accusations, the undeniable hypocrisy, it seems pointless to compromise with fans, leading to one conclusion. You might find it odd, a blow to your ego (communityband1) you're most of the reason for said conclusion. Perhaps, you should've taken the advice you were given. How much more peaceful things could've wound up.﻿

John, you've started every bit of this battle, and you've exposed yourself to criticism. You've levied sick, absurd, and childish accusations against Lindsey that show your immaturity. You will be called a child when you do that. What you are doing with Lindsey is very different from what I'm doing with you. I'm taking your own statements and summarizing them. These are some things you've said. Tell us that from these statements, we can't conclude you are a young guy who has struggled with his personal relationships and turned to Lindsey as a form of compensation for that. Tell us that we can't conclude you take pride in the "Likes" you receive and look down on Lindsey's fans who don't see what you see:

"I'm not some 40-year-old, sitting in his basement, with nothing better to do than troll a famous violinist. Nope, just someone much too young to have had everyone he trusted back-stab him, and, pathetic as it is, someone who only had a violinist, her music, and her story to give him some hope there was something worth fighting for..."

"So, and it's not like it's mature, if biting sarcasm, coupled with the facts to back it up, brings her back down off of cloud 9, and no one else is willing to speak up to someone who's famous, guess I'll have to be the one who's "Brave Enough." After all, got nothing else to lose, already lost everything and everyone else."

"As for the rest of it, because I'm beating my head against a wall, it's a sad thing, looking up to a person, because you don't have anyone else, wanting nothing more than to thank them for teaching you you're not alone, you're not the only who's suffering, and, if you fight, if you're willing to keep going, you can accomplish anything, only to watch them become so entirely obsessed with their fame, their money, it doesn't seem like anything they say is genuine, and, having gotten their fame, nothing matters but stringing their fans along to keep them from losing it. Yeah, everyone wants to feel that kind of pain, like everything they thought about their hero wasn't true."

"Lindsey's music, her story, gave my life purpose, you subjective busybody."

"The question you really have to contemplate the most, however, if absolutely nothing else, is this, if I cared about Lindsey so much, if she was the only person I ever respected, the only person I felt loved by (in the way a celebrity loves her fans, not in the delusional way some nutty people think), if I admired her talent so much, why would I want to put myself through the agony of thinking everything, the joy, the feeling of not being alone, everything I felt because of Lindsey, was a lie?”

"I guess that's the bottom line for me. Lindsey doesn't care anymore, not for anyone, only the things she can get from them, be it compliments or money, not connection, not love, not concern, nothing else but finance and fame."

"There are times I question, why, why can't I see anything good about Lindsey anymore? Why do I keep seeing so much negativity, and I wind up reducing myself to tears, because I don't have an answer, only the things I see, and they're always negative. So, in order to keep myself from breaking down, reduce the pain in my heart, I put up posts like this one, to figure out if it's only me seeing it, and it's not, apparently, as I've had others agree with the things I've said, but it doesn't change the pain, because Lindsey is still getting worse."

"I more so had the utmost respect for her inability to conform, the fact she was able to succeed, essentially by herself, her love for her fans, the feeling she cared, like anyone could, in some way, feel like she was their guardian angel, their hero, and they could feel safe, knowing, if they were hurt, someone understood them, felt it with them, so they were never truly alone. In return, her fans felt the same thing for Lindsey, only makes sense, no?"

"I don't consider myself "the word of the lesser opinion," but it's bizarre how I say it, and, out of nowhere, people agree with me. So, it feels almost obligatory at this point, to say it, as crazy as it is. I've even had people praise me for speaking up for them. Yeah... odd feeling, because I'm not proud of it, but I'm doing good by others, so... it's weird..."

"19 people feel the same, not quite a massive number, but it's enough to perpetuate something's off with the process."

"They'll never know what's amiss. I've got most of them convinced. Through the fake care that I've shown. I've made them think they're not alone. "

"You, like everyone else, don't seem to see the actual issues and boil them down, simplify them, to make them sound ludicrous."﻿

"CWS [Celebrity Worship Syndrome] has been described as an obsessive-addictive disorder where an individual becomes overly involved and interested (in short, completely obsessed) with the details of the personal life of a celebrity. Any person who is ‘in the public eye’ can be the object of a person’s obsession (e.g., authors, politicians, journalists), but research and criminal prosecutions suggest they are more likely to be someone from the world of television, film and/or pop music.

Research suggests that CWS exists and that according to Dr. John Maltby and his colleagues there are three independent dimensions of celebrity worship. These are on a continuum and named (i) entertainment-social, (ii) intense-personal, and (iii) borderline pathological.

• The entertainment-social dimension relates to attitudes where individuals are attracted to a celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain and to become a social focus of conversation with likeminded others.
• The intense-personal dimension relates to individuals that have intensive and compulsive feelings about a celebrity.
• The borderline-pathological dimension relates to individuals who display uncontrollable behaviours and fantasies relating to a celebrity.

Among adults, their research has shown that there is a correlation between the pathological aspects of CWS and poor mental health such as high anxiety, more depression, high stress levels, increased illness, and poorer body image. Among teenage females there is a relationship between intense-personal celebrity worship and body image (basically, teenage girls who identify with celebrities have much poorer body image compared to other groups). In addition, most celebrity-obsessed individuals often suffer high levels of dissociation and fantasy-proneness. Maltby’s research suggests about 1% of his participants have obsessional tendencies towards celebrities.

Research has also shown that worshipping celebrities can have both positive and negative consequences. People who worship celebrities for entertainment and social reasons have been found to be more optimistic, outgoing, and happy. Those who worship celebrities for personal reasons have been found to be more obsessive, more depressed, more anxious, more solitary, more impulsive, more anti-social and more troublesome. So where do you fit into this in terms of celebrity worship? I’ll leave you with some statements so you can assess your own level of celerity worship

Say yes to the following and you may have low-level CWS:

• My friends and I like to discuss what my favourite celebrity has done.
• I enjoy watching my favourite celebrity.
• Learning the life story of my favourite celebrity is a lot of fun.

Agree with these more intense feelings and you may have a moderate case of CWS:

• I consider my favourite celebrity to be my soul mate.
• I have a special bond with my celebrity.
• I have frequent thoughts about my celebrity, even when I don’t want to.

Agree with these and you may be obsessed, borderline pathological and suffering seriously from CWS:

• If someone gave me several thousand pounds to do with as I please, I would consider spending it on a personal possession, like a napkin or paper plate, once used by my favourite celebrity.
• If I were lucky enough to meet my favourite celebrity, and they asked me to do something illegal as a favour I would probably do it.
• I would be very upset if my favourite celebrity got married."


John, I don't think the examples in any of these three exactly match what you've told us. I think it's pretty clear you aren't and never were "stage 3." But I think you understand that the bond you felt with Lindsey went beyond their description here of entertainment-social. Another description of intense-personal I've come across is this: "From the fan’s viewpoint, intense-personal aspects of celebrity worship are associated with passive parasocial relationships (e.g. ‘When something bad happens to my favourite celebrity I feel like it happened to me’)." And that description is very similar to things you've said. 

I believe you need to understand that Lindsey can not be expected to feel the relationship with her fans the same way you described it, because what you described isn't necessarily typical. You once asked this: "...feel like she was their guardian angel, their hero, and they could feel safe, knowing, if they were hurt, someone understood them, felt it with them, so they were never truly alone. In return, her fans felt the same thing for Lindsey, only makes sense, no?" I didn't answer it then, but the answer, I believe, is no, I don't think that makes sense. I think that's going too far with a relationship that should be lighter and less personal. And I think it's why you're having such a difficult time seeing this from Lindsey's point of view. I don't believe she has felt or should have felt a connection with her fans that's as intense as what you describe. And I don't believe she should be expected to anticipate that she even has the power to hurt people's feelings by promoting her products or engaging in common business practices like advertising. I don't guess that she has ever had feelings towards a celebrity which would give her this frame of reference to feel as you do that this could be wrong or hurtful.

"Indeed, if there is a key to being a 'healthy' fan, experts say it is in our ability to enjoy what a celebrity brings to our life, without them becoming our life. 'If you can just have fun with it, if it's not replacing emotional connections in your real life, then it's really all OK,' Aronowitz concludes."﻿

What do you think YouTube employees are doing, sitting around watching as 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute (real figure)? It's all done by software. And they obviously don't program user biases because that would be a bad way to make money and potentially illegal. All the corporations would complain to the EU if something like that went on. Besides Google makes a ton more off of them in advertising dollars than any YouTuber. If they want to show bias to anyone that's where they'd go.

So, it's either the "programming" is faulty, or, as it is, manipulation of the trending page is absolutely common, because there is no way this video would've been there otherwise. What? Did Lindsey accidentally unlock the code on how to get almost every one of her recent crummy, lazy videos on trending, AFTER she became a massive suck up, mind you... Awfully perfect coincidence.

John Avery Trending is calculated by how many views a video gets within a certain time span of that video coming out. The fact that this video never reached 4 million has nothing to do with it.

Possible? What about making money sense and being legal? Forget selling a handful of YouTube Red subs. They make big ad bucks if the trending page points people to videos that go viral. So thats what they try to do. And if YouTube played favorites corporate marketers would throw fits and sue. They watch this stuff you know. If Tim is right this video probably got a lot of views from subscribers but then lost rank when people didn't share it. That's how the software should work.

You're right that the video wasn't on the trending page for long. I first saw it at around 42, and it peaked around 30 before sliding out. It got its first 80,000 views in just a few hours, presumably from subscriptions, but then it slowed way down and slid off the trending page.﻿

To whom are you writing, John? You're not writing to Lindsey, as you've already said. So who else is there except the community here? Are you only writing to people who agree with you? If so, who are they? I don't see any of these people who "liked" your posts finding you, your thoughts, or Lindsey important enough to take time to discuss or defend your opinion. What does that tell you about their opinion? It suggests to me it's an opinion they don't feel strongly about, or perhaps they like the idea of negative feedback on Lindsey's videos. Meanwhile you have a handful of people on most of these threads you've started who do take something seriously enough to respond, whether it's their appreciation of Lindsey, their interest in the facts and the debate, or some hope of helping you see things differently. Those are the only people who seem to stick around and to whom you continue to respond. So if you don't care what any of these people think, why do you continue to start discussions with them and respond to them? Do you want us to believe it's out of respect? That might be easier to sell if you didn't just call most of them sheep.

>> If she did, being my comments find their way to being popular so frequently... actual logic would dictate I wouldn't still be here, because why would she want someone who's not a Stirlingite sheep on her videos?

Why would she ban you? You're no threat to her business. People either like Lindsey's art or they don't. They won't let you help them make up their minds. I think two of your comments may currently appear on the first page of comments, including this one. They seem to fall pretty quickly. I'm not sure if that's because they get disliked or because the rate of new likes for them fades. You've already said you weren't entirely opposed to the idea that a lot of the trolls who immediately dislike each of Lindsey's new videos also may be liking your posts just to boost anything negative about Lindsey, regardless of whether they agree or not.

Here's a new question for you. Don't you think Lindsey has people in her personal life who love her enough that they would take action if she honestly seemed to them to be changing for the worse? Her family, her friends, her church community... these people all seem to care about her deeply. So why do you feel this is your role instead of those who know her best, love her most, and have real access to her? And why don't those people who love her seem worried? Lindsey has talked about how her family intervened when she was struggling with anorexia. We know that they are watching her and step up if she is in trouble. So why is it that the people with the best view of Lindsey's life and the greatest concern for her well-being aren't guiding her away from this, unless it's because they don't think she's actually changing for the worse?﻿

coummunityband1: Well, bravo. You actually presented something of a logical argument. Clap, clap... 

The original person I was attempting to address was Lindsey, quite some time ago, starting on The Arena. As impossible as it seems, my original comments were actually far more polite, all be it still critical, resulting from the fact she hadn't gone completely off the deep end yet, and I still had faith in her (my mistake). It's around the time I realized she had lost it, and she stopped caring about the opinions of her fans, stopped looking at their comments, my comments began shaping into the far more blunt ones you're familiar with presently, getting significantly worse with each new problem. The target of these comments shifted from Lindsey to anyone, ideally those with a similar realization. Whether or not they choose to say it, I think the silent likes on my comments are enough to prove those people exist, but are too intimated to speak freely, although, as I said, you pointed out, and I'm not backtracking on, some of the likes could belong to those who instinctively feel the need to make her feel bad. I don't instantaneously assume the authors of the replies I'm going to get are going to be sheep, not until I've read them. I usually take it one step farther, attempting to rationalize my comments, often in vain, before I realize they are sheep. It's possibly worth pointing out, although I consider you a great many things (most of them not complimentary), I don't view you as a sheep, because you're not entirely sucking up to Lindsey, like the typical Stirlingite. So, there's the answer to part 1. 

If she bans someone from her social media, which I've witnessed a few times, I have very little question in my mind I would be gone, because Lindsey doesn't like criticism. She does like blocking it, though... I'm simply not dimwitted enough to open my mouth on her Twitter and Instagram, being it's swarming with mindless suck ups, who would flood her with likes if she typed the word "chicken..." Seriously, you presented me with possibly having CWS. You would have your work cut out for you there, because almost every single one of them has it, some beyond delusional (como violeta)... You're likely not going to get the reference in parenthesis (communityband1), translated or not, but someone likely gets my reference. There's part 2. 

Do you mean the same people she's mentioned feeling like a "misfit" among (in reference to her church)? Do you mean the same people she never listens to, even though they have presented issues to her, in the past 2 months (in reference to members of her faith)? Do you mean the people she claims are responsible for her business wise i.e. the ones who have then supported her selling out already (in reference to her management)? Do you mean the people she pays (in reference to her team)? Do you mean the one she has lying to her fans for her (in reference to her sister, Jennifer, better known as "Lindsey Stirling's Assistant," which is watermarked on her emails)? Do you mean the one who has her own life to deal with and wouldn't notice the change (in reference to her other sister)? Do you mean the people she already shoved into her advertisement for HP, and she gets support from for selling out, but she rarely supports back (in reference to her YouTube friends)? Do you mean the person who suffered a terrible loss recently and wouldn't be able to notice the shift (in reference to her mother)? Huh... based on everything given, you tell me if someone would be able to say anything about her dramatic shift...﻿

>>I think the silent likes on my comments are enough to prove those people exist, but are too intimated to speak freely...

I don't see this. I see people willing to take up and defend individual parts of arguments you make, parts which on the surface seem much more likely to have others who might have similar thoughts. This comment here started off as a complaint about which videos make it on trending, and a few people agreed with you on that much in the comments. A mathematical approach to the problem can likely explain why we should expect to see what we see, but I fully anticipate people will look at this and on the surface see no rhyme or reason. You've talked about how people complained about HP advertising when it became more prominent. Again, while I personally have a different perspective, it's easy to anticipate some will complain. Many have voiced their negative opinions of Lindsey's music when it's something they don't like. They can receive opposing replies from LIndsey's fans, but they don't seem to feel intimidated. Studies have shown how the anonymity of the internet emboldens people, and we've seen people freely oppose Lindsey where they feel inclined to do so. 

So I don't think we can conclude intimidation is to blame here. I think people like and comment on the parts of your statements they agree with. But the deeper you go, the less they seem to follow.

>>...because Lindsey doesn't like criticism. 

That's implausible. Lindsey has entered into a career where she gets more criticism of her work in a month than most people get in a lifetime. She has chosen a life that's full of criticism, which means it can't bother her too much. If she bans people, it will most certainly be for doing something against community rules, and in those cases, it may actually be the social media company's doing. Please share specific examples if you can prove otherwise.

>>Seriously, you presented me with possibly having CWS. You would have your work cut out for you there, because almost every single one of them has it...

Yes, when you operate on her social media accounts, you will certainly run into anyone who is overly invested in Lindsey. I think this may be unhelpful to you, because it might be healthier to gauge your thoughts and interests strictly against people who are disconnected from this sort of thing and perhaps a little more representative of the overall population. In a sense a community of people who may be too invested in following Lindsey's life may give you a sense of safety that doesn't ultimately serve you very well.

I also encourage you to compare the comment counts on these videos to the overall subscriber count to get an indication of just what percentage of her "fans" participate here. There are 658 comments on this video, and even if we assumed each person only posted once, it would still mean that only 658 of over 9 million subscribers were involved. We can fudge that around quite a bit, since we wouldn't expect even the most devoted fans to comment on everything she posts, but as you can imagine, we're going to have trouble getting to any figures which show her active follower community, the group that closely follows her life, is anything but a tiny fraction of her overall audience. And that's important for a couple of reasons. First, it tells Lindsey that the vast majority of her audience is primarily interested in her content, and if she wants to post material relevant to them, it should be about that. Second, it tells you and me that we would both be unwise to justify our own interest in Lindsey's life by comparing it to other people here. If we found that we were more invested than the average person here, it would mean we're at a pretty far extreme in terms of overall society. But in general I agree with the psychologists I quoted. I think it makes sense to say that if our interest is creating a positive result in our lives, it's okay, and if not, then it's something we should change.

>>...Do you mean the same people...

I mean all the people who spend time with her and love her. And I firmly believe you agree, privately, that they exist and would speak up if they felt something was off. You wouldn't be kept from showing love and concern for people you care about just because you faced challenges in your own life. Neither would the people who love Lindsey. This is their job, not ours.﻿

communityband1: The part I'm not fully grasping is, in the past, the number of likes on one of my negative comments exceeded the number of dislikes on the actual video itself. What does that imply? Does it mean the content itself wasn't disliked by them, but my criticizing of Lindsey's person was something they agreed with, because they believed it to be accurate? What's also needed to be taken into consideration is there are people who have stood in my defense and vice versa. However, those people have never wound up turning up on another video. Did they simply give up on Lindsey, or are they quietly liking my posts? 

If you wind up in a profession commonly encountering criticism, it doesn't mean it's not going to bother you. As I said, Lindsey doesn't care for people saying anything negative about her, in any regard, or presenting an unfavorable assumption about her views on certain topics. A few times, she's gone out of her way to make certain those assumptions are discredited, likely to prevent her image from being tarnished. It's pretty much the only time she addresses anything negative. Otherwise, as I've said in the past, she ignores it, because it presents no chance of her image being stained. However, if it becomes too much of an issue, she no longer ignores it, and she blocks it's origin, to prevent further commenting. Trust me. I shouldn't still be here, but I am, giving me the impression she isn't paying attention to these comments. Also, I'm not fully getting your request for specific examples. Are you requesting the conversations of the people she's blocked, to give you some indication of why, because they get removed with the blocking of said person.  

I don't agree with a group of Stirlingites sucking up to Lindsey constantly and thinking she can do no wrong, is perfect in every way, and devote a good chunk of their lives waiting for her to post a picture... So, I'm in no danger of getting a sense of safety from them. If anything, it makes me resent them for being sheep... 

I think we've already established we're both too invested in this, for different reasons, but neither one of us truly knows what the other's reason is, because both of us have presented ambiguous hints in our speech, but nothing concrete has been established as to the reason we're both so invested. 

A bold statement... No, unless there's some inner reaches of the ever-fading faith I had in her clinging onto such a thought, the one people who love her actually opening their mouths about her becoming x, y, and z, there's nothing else to give me the indication anyone would say anything. They could be equally as blind as her fans, or they even be a factor in her becoming x, y, and z. Lindsey often places more trust in people she shouldn't than she realizes. Your manager isn't your mother, and, push come to shove, her job is to make money from Lindsey, not protect her, and not to dissuade her from a business proposition. You'll recall from someone mentioning it a while ago, she has wound up in the hospital. So, how much concern is there for her well-being, and does her personality, an irrelevant factor, really concern those aiming for profit? Lindsey isn't with her family for months I'll remind you. How much would they notice, would they see?﻿

John, as I said, I fully expect some people to agree with some things you say. Advertising is easy to get people to complain about. But you lose nearly all of that support when you make overarching statements about the implications for Lindsey's character. People don't follow you there or agree, especially those who have followed her career.

As far as criticism goes, as Lindsey says, she's developed pretty thick skin. The more we're subjected to criticism, the less it affects us. It would surprise me greatly if you were banned for sharing criticism. If she felt anything about it, I think it would be concern for you, because I'm certain she doesn't feel you are correct. I can see two more likely explanations for the disappearance of those threads. The less likely is that a company asked Lindsey to remove comments which didn't serve their interests. More likely, I believe, is that YouTube may have an automated system for removing comments that are reported by many users. Whether or not the comments were legitimate, if they were prominent on a page frequented by Lindsey's fans, they would almost certainly have been marked by multiple people.

I don't think it's bold to say Lindsey has people in her life who love her. She's with a tight group of friends on the road. She has a supportive family. She's dating a man who seems enamored with her. These people know her best. As I've said, we can't magically transform our beliefs and values or our core personality when we move between our personal and professional lives. We can act a role to do our job, but we still believe and feel the same things. Those people who are around Lindsey know who she is and know if she is hurting. 

I think we should understand that the strength of Lindsey's personal life is exactly why she doesn't need to build up a personal life online with fans, beyond what she needs to be successful in her business. Her social community is established in real life, and that's where she wants to keep it. We should all strive for that. I think Lindsey would do you a disservice by helping you continue to rely on her in ways you've expressed. If things are missing from your personal relationships, that's where the attention needs to be.﻿

No, like I said, people have supported my claims on her personality, too, saying she's "become warped by the evil of the music industry, and her shining inner beauty has been tainted by indulgence." Okay, I'll grant you this much in that it sounds like this person got a little bit preacher-esc, but it's still someone who gets my point.

Regardless, no one is immune to feelings, as even the most hard-shelled people have the capability of sadness, and she's not exactly "thick-skinned" to begin with, contrary to her own self praise. The fact is she's developed different, all be it obvious, ways of expressing hers. I'm not claiming to be a psychologist, but, if she liked someone's post saying, "you looked upset today," she's looking for attention, because she wanted someone to notice she was upset. If she feels the need to discredit a random person's statement, but only if it would make her look bad, she minds their opinion. However, as I said, YouTube has become her least concern, ironically, as she'll put more effort into her Twitter than this account. How long's it been since a legitimate video, a month and a half? If they cut her paycheck, though, because they established new requirements, there would be videos every other day... 

You're still not getting the logic here. If she's away from her family, they aren't going to notice anything, being they won't be around her. The people she's with care far more about her paying them, and they wouldn't so "pally" if she couldn't next week. When she's off from touring, you think she's spending time with them like they're a close knit group of friends from high school? Seriously? So, their focus is money first, worry about anything she becomes next, or not at all. You really like giving everyone and everything but me, or anyone like me, the benefit of the doubt, huh? 

You're entirely missing the mark on your assumptions, possibly a misinterpretation of my previous claims, saying she's some form of comfort for reasons she simply isn't, and I expect her to treat every fan like she's their friend. I'm not nearly so delusional. Yes, certain fans have said, "I consider her a good friend," to which I've felt bad, because she's not your friend, and she never will be, but my issue is far more reasonable. Brace yourself to delve into this happy mess.

There exists a number of rings, let's say, for simplicity sake, each new ring farther from you on a personal level, each one breaking into smaller rings within them, to establish closeness within each ring. There's one for your family. There's one for your next family, significant other  and kids. There's one for your friends. There's one for your pets. This goes on and on for a while, but you get my point. Somewhere in this mess of rings, there are your fans. They aren't as close as family or friends, likely not even pets, but they aren't as far away as say a person you do business with, because most of them don't view you as simply an entertainer, so you shouldn't view them simply as another dollar in your pocket. The concern Lindsey used to show was one of the respect you should have for your fans, not too close, but not giving off the impression you weren't another dollar. Yet, Lindsey decided to take it a step farther, occasionally speaking to individual people, sharing things she likely shouldn't have, and making them realize she wasn't some faceless celebrity, creating a stronger connection. Suddenly, she cut the connection, not gradually, and her fans, like it or not, became the ring of a person you do business with, as she operated under the guise of maintaining the ring she no longer held. In actuality, her fans became a number, the more I have, the more I make, the less I care about the fewer, the more I care about the greater, and the only time you individually matter to me, is when you flatter me, say with art or something, you're paying me, or you can somehow make others want to follow me. That's it. I don't care about your issues, your life, only those three things. I'll pretend I do, if you buy a meet and greet, but I really don't care. I stopped caring. I got my fame. I just need to keep it. Whether or not you (communityband1) agree with everything (you won't agree with anything) isn't my issue, but there's the thought process. Yes, her music is awful lately, like her videos. Yes, she has become a sell out. Yes, I still think her hair is awful... However, would any of this matter to me if this one issue didn't spark everything? No. I don't think would've. Lindsey did something wrong, which you don't seem to notice. It's like you said. She should've had the connection entertainers do with fans. However, she started her career treating her fans beyond the way most entertainers would, and she suddenly decided to cut it, making those fans question, "did she ever actually care, ever want to tell her story to show they weren't the only ones dealing with something she made them feel like they weren't the only ones, or was it because she ultimately wanted to get fame, by pretending, wanting her fans' sympathy, trust?" Either way, it's heartless. Of course, if you don't want to feel so betrayed, you lie to yourself, like her fans do, thinking "she's not like that." Well, guess what. She is like that, because, again, either way you slice it, if she cut off her connection, not considering the feelings of anyone else, or she did everything for fame, she did something she shouldn't have, and she's morally backwards for either one reason or several.﻿

John, please stop. :-) People love Lindsey. She has rich relationships with her friends and family. She interacts with them outside of work all the time. It's bonkers to say that someone as likable as Lindsey has nobody in her daily life who actually likes her, or that her employees stick with a job for years where they share a tour bus with a boss they only tolerate because they get paid. Lindsey has very close friendships with people in and out of work. Work is where many of us end up making our closest friends as adults. As Malece writes on Twitter, "Just so grateful to do what I love with people that I love" - May 2017. "My boss is so cooooll" - Oct 2016.  And I don't have to remind anyone what Gavi meant to Lindsey and the entire team. They're not faking the fun and love we see in the behind-the-scenes. That happens when people with a lot in common spend tons of time together. And no, I'm not saying they're like a group of friends from high school. This is so much richer than that. This is a small group of friends who travel the world enjoying the experience of a lifetime together. That's something amazing.

"Had the most wonderful day with my best friends @lindseystirling @kitnolan @coldhunnid @victoriathornberry !!! Had some time on a hiking trail topped off with this wonderful pizza from 786 degrees and A Harry Potter night!" - Drew Steen June 22, 2017

"Yesterday was so fun. I'm so grateful for your friendship and I know that we were put into each others lives for a reason." Lindsey Stirling

John, thank you for explaining further, but really, I get it. It's unfortunate that you placed Lindsey in a position in your life where her actions can affect you negatively. But that truly was your doing. It is not an inevitable consequence of anything she has said or done. Your negative feelings are stronger and more prolonged than those of nearly everyone else we've seen. You need to take that to heart and understand the difference is in you, and you have the power to control it. Again, please revisit what those psychologists said about the limits for how much and in what ways celebrities should affect us. Lindsey can't be the reason for your pain. She's just not in a position where she has or could acquire that power through any action of her own. We can go into endless evidence that Lindsey still cares about people and still appreciates the support she gets. But for that to become clear, I think you need to accept the unusual nature of your reaction and take responsibility for it. It hasn't served you, and you alone have power over it.﻿

That is a false statement, John. Musab Abdullatif was actually the first one to reply to your ridiculous rant. So I suggest you stop putting out obvious lie that you know are lies, and stop fighting this battle you know you aren't going to win.﻿

Astrid's Life: "who was one of the first..." were my exact words. I suppose your mind could've made it seem the other way around, but I think it's just because you don't pay attention... Either way, don't you feel smart... 

<p>communityband1: I don't think you seem to understand, much as you claim to, but, as I said, it's of little consequence. I've already had this discussion, in depth, with another person I felt didn't analyze things the same way you tend to, which is very robotic. I'd imagine you two would have quite the contrast of opinions in methods of handling things, based solely on your previous interactions in the past. It's likely for that reason, I had little trouble explaining things with them I don't feel like you would ever grasp, because you come off as apathetic, whereas they seemed far more willing to listen than to speak, help instead of argue, realize the situation but not place blame on me. It's still a genuine surprise they're not present in this video, at least not that I've noticed, likely the result of not wanting to deal with a third party throwing in their two cents... Regardless, if they didn't seem bothered, though weren't in full support of, the way I imagine things going, I don't see any reason why I need a second opinion from you. Don't go searching, either. I'd imagine they don't want you bugging them, which is why I'm not saying names, and they deleted the entire discussion. The fact is someone gets it, and being it's obvious to me where your thought process is, their opinion is of more importance to me...﻿

John, you've assigned responsibility for your emotions and actions to others. Lindsey "created" your way of handling things. People stabbed you in the back, making you turn to Lindsey. That type of thinking takes away your power to make yourself a happier, more successful person. You started this because you were unhappy, and you now continue to linger in this negative place. Full stop. That's proof beyond any doubt that you need to shift your strategy. Lindsey never had any power to do this to you. Thousands of others were subjected to the same stimuli and haven't reached pain and anger as a result. You need to see that the difference here is in you. And that's exactly where you want it, because you have full control there.

I still suggest talking to a psychologist. You're young, and this is a wonderful time to invite some true expert advice that can make a positive impact on many areas of your life. I've known many highly intelligent people who have benefited from this and thoroughly recommend it. It can easily pay for itself down the line for virtually anyone. People learn not only about themselves but also gain insight into others that can help grow their friendships and careers.

I want to revisit one little thing. I believe you will find that the order of your circles will change as you get older. I think looking back I can see where I might have seen an order similar to yours when I was young. But that changed as people spent more time with friends and coworkers than family, at least until they built new families of their own. I certainly feel much more responsibility to coworkers and people I do business with than to fans of my work. I'm a part of my coworkers' lives, and my actions have very direct consequences for them. Lindsey, too, should feel much more responsible to those she works and does business with than to people who can decide whether or not to watch her videos, purchase her albums, or read her comments and life story. We fans have (or should have) no real skin in the game. Lindsey has no actual power to hurt us with her actions unless we're doing something psychologists explain we should not be doing. And if we are, then we have no cause to complain about anything which makes us stop.

I think as you grow older you will also find that your impression of the power of money will greatly diminish. People sacrifice wealth for other things at practically every turn. Friendships, line of work, the chance to watch favorite TV programs... I just can't think back and find anyone I've encountered in my entire life who has truly made money the top priority. People value quality of life in the here and now above just about anything, even if they aren't always good at achieving it. I've already listed ways Lindsey willfully passes up millions in additional revenue so she can live the way she wants. From all I've seen, that just makes her ordinary.﻿

It's like I said, you're not seeing the full picture, and you never will, because you have little knowledge on the circumstances, other than vague mentions, of my situation. You're the type of person, as I've established, to get an inch and take a mile. So, it's very easy for you to say this and that, because you lack context, quite a lot of it, and unless you have context, you can't suggest anything. Do yourself a favor, being you're not "learning" anything from this, stop wasting your time. There are a great deal of better things for you to be doing than spending your energy on a lost cause. This is a lost cause. I already figured out how to get over this, and I couldn't care less if it's not the mature way. It's like you've established, Lindsey doesn't care what anyone says to her, so she won't be bothered by someone telling her she's x, y, and z. It'll likely go in one ear and out the other one...﻿

You could tell a psychologist only this: "For the last several months, I've been very upset with a celebrity I used to admire, and I've been posting spiteful comments on her videos and regularly spending hours engaging in long fights with her fans." That psychologist is going to know right off the bat that something is amiss, you are likely too invested in this celebrity, and you need some guidance. That alone is enough context. But don't take my word for it. Ask. You can stay anonymous and get some free input online through a psychology forum. The only reason not to do this is if you are worried you won't like the result. And that would actually be a very good reason to do it.

Psychologists aren't for nutcases. A 2004 study showed that nearly half of American households had at least one member who visited a psychologist in the previous year.

Oh I am still learning things. Writing practice alone is valuable to me. And I'm still doing research as well. Here are a few more interesting quotes from an expert in this area -

"Celebrity life coach Sloan Sheridan-Williams, who has clients from the UAE travel to see her in London, or get help through online consultations, is familiar with the growing problem. ‘CWS is a form of obsessive disorder that in its non-pathological form is based around an intense preoccupation with fame or what celebrities are doing,’ she says.

This can include something as simple as a fascination about the latest weight-loss fad A-listers are trying, but it could also include strong opinions about decisions made by boy band members such as Zayn.

‘In its most extreme form sufferers could even display characteristic traits of psychoticism – a personality pattern characterised by aggressiveness and interpersonal hostility – and is an important impulse to keep an eye on,’Sloan says."

"‘Social media and the ability to have your voice heard about your favourite celebrities in turn encourages a culture of dependency among fans and it’s a big concern in today’s heavily media-driven world,’ Sloan says. ‘Fans have an over-identification with celebrities and also their importance in celebrities’ lives.’ "

"Sloan says children can often be looking to the outside world to provide an answer for negative emotions they’re feeling in their lives. By focusing their energy on someone else, they don’t have to deal with the feelings within. Mum Beth has since discovered that her daughter’s obsession with Zayn arose as she was a victim of bullying at school. ‘Ava’s breakdown over Zayn was actually the result of everything she was dealing with,’ she explains. ‘I trivialised it as an immature reaction to a boy leaving a band, but in fact, her reaction was really about being picked on. She’d followed One Direction to escape her troubles and when Zayn left it rocked the one thing she was clinging on to. ‘We’re now bringing her back to reality and helping her face her problems.’"﻿

communityband1: I don't think you realize the more information you put, the more robotic you sound, and the more likely people are to shut down. I'm aware you're knowledgeable on certain things, and I don't need it written down for me. I'll try to put this in perspective for you, one last time. If you can, imagine a person using a crutch for a bad injury. Yes, it's possible for them to move without the crutch, but infinitely harder, and it leaves them open to the possibility of even more damage with a fall. If they have the crutch, though, they still have the injury, but it becomes tolerable, and the person is less likely to fall, cause more damage, etc. When the crutch has served its purpose, the person, who had much less of a difficult journey to being healed, leaves the crutch behind, able to resume their own life, the injury a forgotten memory. If the fully healed person still uses the crutch, though, it no longer serves them as a benefit, only a hindrance, because they can move more freely without having it. However, if a person is still injured, still using the crutch, and it abruptly breaks, what happens? The person falls, and the injury is further damaged from landing on it full force. If they get help, the injury takes longer to heal, but it will get better, with the help of a different crutch. If the person doesn't get help, in the same scenario, at best, the injury is healed improperly, but they're never the same. At worst, use your imagination. The crutch is anyone close to you, the person is anyone who's injured for one reason or another. It's still none of your business, the specifics, but I needed a crutch for my "injury," and several of them broke abruptly on me, making every fall worse, damaging it further, so many times, it became a question of was there even a point in standing up another time, or lay face down until everything went black. You think your friends always have the best intentions in mind or the people closest to you? I'll give you a taste of the real world. It's not always like that... So, where does one turn without the most "reliable" crutches to help them? They'll turn to the person they feel would understand their situation, until they're healed, and they can move on by themselves. I turned to Lindsey, because she seemed like one of the few people who would get it, and her words, music, etc served as a perfect crutch, as the slow healing process, from countless falls in past, began mending my injury, until, like so many times prior, the crutch broke... You're funny, thinking I worshiped Lindsey. No, I simply needed her until I was able to stand on my own two feet, having no one else. I couldn't do it by myself, and there's nothing wrong admitting it, either, because not everyone has an iron will, and they need support. What exactly do I need a psychologist to tell me? I get everything, and I had no intention of continuing to use the crutch past the point I was healed, because it would've been a hindrance. I simply had it break before I was even remotely healed, causing more damage and pain, pain I simply can't deal with anymore. Lindsey doesn't have the ability to cause pain, huh? Well, I guess I'm imagining the last person I decided to put my faith in turning out to be x, y, and z being a bit difficult for me to handle... You'll never get it, because you'll never be in the same situation, and I'm glad for that, because no one else should, others are, but no one should.﻿

That's a fair question - what could a psychologist do for you? Extremely bright professionals I've known have said they learned effective coping strategies and learned to identify where their own interpretations of situations were leading them astray. They also felt that talking to someone who is both highly experienced and dedicated to them was healing. Maybe you can look around online to just find some reports of what other people say about their experience. Coming from me as advice this idea may feel hostile or demeaning. So maybe it's worth seeing what other people get out of it. As I've said before, psychologists aren't for dumb people who don't know which things are wrong in their lives. Psychologists have the benefit of a wealth of experience from the lives of many people, and they've chosen their careers because they genuinely like people and like to listen and help.

I don't like stepping into analogies, because it's very easy to get sucked into an analogy and overemphasize its applicability. We can wrap ourselves up into our own imagination as we invent them, and it's easy to over-simplify the things we're comparing. But I'll go ahead and try to say what I think about your crutch analogy. I think - and I'd much prefer you talk to an expert about this - that instead of thinking of these crutches as objects or people, we should identify them as actions. Lindsey is just a person far away from you who has no power to influence your life. Your crutch isn't her, but how you've used her and the content she produces. Similarly, posting these negative responses to her videos and engaging in ongoing fights with people is an action that's essentially a crutch, because you're doing it in response to something that bothers you - a pain of sorts.

The reason I want to emphasize this distinction is that actions (crutches) can be poisonous. They can literally make things worse on a physical level. I'm not inventing this. Years ago I became interested in how the internet and the anonymity it affords us might affect our psychological growth. In many ways, we're all a bunch of guinea pigs with the new social environment the internet provides. We can express ourselves angrily to others for hours on end with absolute anonymity. That's something that didn't happen to people living 20 years ago, and it essentially amounts to a huge psychological experiment on a new generation of people. We don't really know for sure how it will affect us. Can people really spend hours of their lives every day writing hateful comments towards other people and not be changed by it? As far as I know, the research is still limited. But what I discovered is that the studies that had been done concluded that such behavior did in fact have negative, compounding effects. The more people engaged in anti-social activity online, the more other bad things developed in their lives, and worst of all, the more likely they became to continue doing it. It was effectively damaging and addictive behavior.

I only studied psychology for a couple of years, so you're right that I'm definitely no expert. And that's why I suggest considering a real expert opinion or at least looking at some feedback from people who have tried it. We ask friends for their input all the time. So it's a little ironic that it can feel strange or threatening to us to ask someone who actually knows what they're talking about. :-)﻿

communityband1: It's a very strange sort of circumstance, isn't it? Your comments don't write, and five or so others disappear, almost like it was being monitored... Regardless, as far as the situation, I've spoken to two professionals in the past, in terms of my "injury," not this, and I can easily say, seven sessions later with one, I sat down with a person who told me everything I wanted to hear, but she never properly developed a way of fixing the issue, and three sessions with the other, "I'll advise you to take this and that..." I sat down with someone who solves everything with prescriptions..." So, based on those, I'm not seeing a third person for this, because I doubt the probability of success. I've said this already, it's not first time I've "fallen," only the hardest one, because I had the past ones. The difference is I've been able to say my piece to the ones who pained me, and although it took time to get past them, through finding a new crutch, I was able to get past them, for the most part, but I still needed to have my word. The problem, as we've gathered, Lindsey never heard anything. So, even though I'll never be able to go to another concert ever again (not like I would want to with everything she's turned into and will become) I can get peace of mind, and I'll vanish from the comments of any future videos, because, in spite of your suggestion, something like being told your x, y, and z, hearing it, it sticks with you, which is all I'll need, knowing, "well, she knows someone doesn't think she's so perfect now." I'm positive you're going to write a response, saying it's nonsense, but it's the only thing I can safely say will work. Therefore, you write your response, and I'll read it, but I think it's best to let you have the last word on this one, being I really don't have much else to say.﻿
